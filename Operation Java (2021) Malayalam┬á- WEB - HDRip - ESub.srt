'The person you are calling
is speaking to someone else.'

11
00:02:06,524 --> 00:02:08,477
'You can wait or call again later.'

'You can wait or call again later.'

20
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,405
Sir.

21
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,488
What's the problem?

22
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:57,446
Who is she talking to
at this hour?

23
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:02,408
What is it? Open up, sir.

24
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:04,321
Ratheesh, don't make me tense.

25
00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:06,325
You can't imagine how worried I'm.

26
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:08,821
I can understand only if
you tell me why you're worried.

27
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:11,116
Any problem with your wife?

28
00:03:11,196 --> 00:03:12,738
Are you guys fighting
over something?

29
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:21,075
'Hi Sweetheart, what's up?'

30
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:22,866
How long have I been calling you?
- 'Sorry, I didn't see your call.'

31
00:03:22,946 --> 00:03:25,825
To whom were you talking?
- 'I... From Oman...'

32
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,241
At 2.00 am, midnight, huh?

33
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,803
'Sweetheart...I'm...'
- How could you do this to me?

34
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:30,956
'What have I done to you, honey?'

35
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:33,988
Did you forget, I bought you
a very costly I-phone?

36
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:37,158
Since then, you're always online
either on Facebook,

37
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:39,200
or WhatsApp.
I never get you on call.

38
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,030
'Why do you sound like
a male chauvinist?'

39
00:03:41,392 --> 00:03:44,575
'Dear, when you go to work, I must
pass my time, isn't it?'

40
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:47,374
Listen Raji, don't try to
make a fool out of me.

41
00:03:47,454 --> 00:03:49,002
'Jaison, you better
speak decently.'

42
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:50,823
Don't say anything more.
- 'I will say.'

43
00:03:50,903 --> 00:03:52,033
You must be available
whenever I call you.

44
00:03:52,113 --> 00:03:53,450
'If you try to control me,
I will talk back for sure.'

45
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,613
You're messing with a cop.
- 'So what if you're a cop?'

46
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:57,821
Hello.

47
00:03:58,292 --> 00:03:59,405
Hello.

48
00:04:00,672 --> 00:04:01,783
How dare she hang up my call?
- Sir.

49
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:03,533
You should not be so
nasty to your wife.

50
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,738
Too bad.

51
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,217
Whose wife, you mean?

52
00:04:08,297 --> 00:04:09,240
Isn't she your wife?

53
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,375
Are you crazy?

54
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:13,238
She is just a woman I met
at the station eight months ago.

55
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:14,848
I'm just having fun with
her, that's all.

56
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,241
And now, she acts like
a faithful wife.

57
00:04:24,321 --> 00:04:26,658
She's talking to her husband
in Oman, now at 2.00 am.

58
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:28,941
It just turned my mood off.

59
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:34,071
Buddy…

60
00:04:34,363 --> 00:04:35,613
That thing, right?

61
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:38,741
What is its name? Er...

62
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:40,405
G-spot?
- Yeah, G-spot.

63
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:42,238
What did you just say?

64
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:44,321
Hey, give me the internet thing.

65
00:04:45,155 --> 00:04:47,071
It's 'Hotspot'.
- Yeah, that 'Pot' itself.

66
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:51,863
See if it has come.

67
00:04:52,613 --> 00:04:53,950
What's the password?

68
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,158
Aatukalamma.

69
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:56,280
What?

70
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,410
Aatukaalamma.

71
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,488
What a crappy password,
Ratheesh?

72
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,038
My wife created it for me, sir.

73
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,107
Hurray!

74
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:08,613
Look at this.
- What is it?

75
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:10,745
Is it okay?

76
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:12,925
Wow!

77
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:16,988
Sir, do you have the seventh clip?
- Which one?

78
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,450
That of Solar Girl?

79
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,036
No, I have a new one.

80
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:21,863
Sunny Leon.
See if you like it.

81
00:05:22,336 --> 00:05:24,405
Wow! It's HD.

82
00:05:24,622 --> 00:05:27,280
Sir, send it to me, please.
- See the video clarity.

83
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:29,363
What is it?
- Please send it to me.

84
00:05:29,715 --> 00:05:30,738
You want it?
- Yes.

85
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:32,200
I can send it to you if you want.

86
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,280
But don't utter my name if my wife
catches you red-handed.

87
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:36,658
Sir, do you think anyone would
tell your name to his wife?

88
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:38,071
What are you saying?

89
00:05:38,465 --> 00:05:39,783
Oh, shit, the storage space
is too less.

90
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:41,325
Yes, it's rotating.
- I have sent it.

91
00:05:41,405 --> 00:05:43,488
Huh, it's rotating, it's rotating.

92
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:50,321
Sir.
- Pick the call.

93
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:58,153
'Hello, Ratheesh sir.'
- Hello, sir.

94
00:05:58,405 --> 00:05:59,533
'Have you reached the spot?'

95
00:05:59,613 --> 00:06:02,950
'We are here at the street café,
behind the BSNL quarters.'

96
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,491
'We're on the road to the right
of the same BSNL quarters.'

97
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:06,575
'Shall we get in, sir?'

98
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:08,575
But sir isn't it raining
heavily outside?

99
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:10,071
'Do we have
to bother with the rain?'

100
00:06:10,155 --> 00:06:11,530
'He's online now.'

101
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,283
'If we enter now, we can
catch him right away.'

102
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:14,571
Yeah, we're coming, sir.

103
00:07:11,994 --> 00:07:15,328
Sir, it's
the fourth house from here.

104
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,661
Sir, follow us.

105

Hello.

Hello.

112
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:51,286
Hey, sir asked you to
meet him upstairs.

113
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:52,869
Okay.
- Go, quick.

114

[Indistinct chatter]

115
00:07:59,286 --> 00:08:00,623
Sir.
- What is it?

116
00:08:00,703 --> 00:08:02,206
Aneesh sir, from the Cyber cell
called me here.

117
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:03,681
What time?
- 'Sir, any updates?'

118
00:08:03,761 --> 00:08:04,996
Yes, the report will be
submitted today evening.

119
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:07,411
We have informed FEFKA and
Producer's association.

120
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:09,123
We just need a few updates
from the Piracy squad.

121
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:10,914
'Sir, please give us
the news first.' - Okay.

122
00:08:10,994 --> 00:08:12,184
'It's for airing an exclusive news.'

123
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:13,893
Venu, there's a press conference
in the evening.

124
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:14,931
'I firmly believe in you and...'

125
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:16,581
Let's discuss the rest
of things there.

126
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:18,024
'I just need a byte for scrolling.'
- You hang up.

127
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:20,119
I'll call you back. Okay.
- 'Sir, please... our TRP...'

128
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:26,292
Ramanathan, everyone, including
you and I know that,

129
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,423
the video that has gone
viral on social media,

130
00:08:28,503 --> 00:08:31,703
in the name of your
wife, Janaki, is fake.

131
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:34,058
She is a Srikankan lady.

132
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:35,572
Do you still need a Cyber- forensic,

133
00:08:35,652 --> 00:08:36,933
report when things
are crystal clear?

134
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,933
We need it, sir.

135
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:42,965
Then, give me a request in writing.
- Here it is.

136
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:56,686
We will forward this to
Thiruvananthapuram.

137
00:08:56,766 --> 00:08:58,599
They will send us
a report on this.

138
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,856
We can file a writ in
the court after,

139
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:01,612
receiving the Cyber-forensic report.

140
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:03,599
Prathapan sir,

141
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:07,016
if it reaches the court, the media
will have a field day.

142
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:08,561
Do we have to go for it?

143
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:09,849
Isn't it risky?

144
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:11,724
Let's see.

145
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:13,553
Don't worry. You may go.

146
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:14,641
I'll call you.

147
00:09:15,183 --> 00:09:16,901
Don't panic.
- Okay.

148
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,825
Come.

149
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:44,728
Sir, I was asked to come here.

150
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:46,683
Is this what you're up to
right in the morning, huh?

151
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:48,144
Sir, please don't make an issue.

152
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:49,478
You needn't utter a word.

153
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:50,984
Yesterday, the girl and her mom
were yelling over this.

154
00:09:51,064 --> 00:09:52,603
I won't repeat it, sir.
- Take out your mobile phone.

155
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:54,397
Sir, it was a mistake. - This is not
how you make a mistake.

156
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:56,058
Show me your mobile.
Give it to me.

157
00:09:56,183 --> 00:09:57,561
Sir, my phone...
- Go and stand there.

158
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:59,603
His love and black mailing.
- Sir, I have deleted everything.

159
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,496
Get the printout
of the case report, quick.

160
00:10:01,576 --> 00:10:02,769
Oh, Ravi, were you on leave?

161
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:04,878
No, I wasn't... I had
gone out to nab,

162
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,728
the accused in Mulanthuruthy
ATM fraud case,

163
00:10:06,808 --> 00:10:09,175
along with the cops at
Thripunithara station.

164
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:11,050
Could you catch them?
- Just that our money went waste.

165
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,890
It happens.
- No use talking about it.

166
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,519
Sir, what's wrong?
- I lost my ATM card.

167
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:16,603
You should never write
the PIN on ATM cards.

168
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,853
I didn't know that. - Sir, please
call the bank and block her card.

169
00:10:19,156 --> 00:10:20,894
Aneesh sir, our internet is down.

170
00:10:20,974 --> 00:10:22,603
I'm using my own personal
data card to access the internet.

171
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:23,891
Cyber Cell, it seems.

172
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:26,186
Where is Baiju sir?
- He is in Prathapan sir's cabin.

173
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,184
Sanjay, isn't it ready? Didn't you
keep a copy of the Chennai police's FIR?

174
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:30,474
Is it not aligned?
- Yes, it is.

175
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,183
Where is Joy sir?
- He's over there.

176
00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:34,569
Joy sir,

177
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:35,721
Please sign it.

178
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,808
That producer has gone mad.

179
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,168
For leaking someone else' cinema,
it's us who must go behind it.

180
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,943
I don't know how to write, dear.

181
00:10:46,475 --> 00:10:49,019
Aunt, it's your money. Don't write
the PIN on your card, okay?

182
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:51,353
Okay, son. - Sir, please come
over after this is done.

183
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,519
Who asked you to come here?
- Anwar.

184
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,766
What's going on here?
- Your tea is kept there.

185
00:10:55,953 --> 00:10:57,519
Which Anwar?
- Anwar Rasheed.

186
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:59,891
The producer of the
movie, Premam.

187
00:11:00,936 --> 00:11:03,139
Look, this case has already
been closed.

188
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:04,686
There's nothing we can
do about it.

189
00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:06,343
This is a closed file.
You may go.

190
00:11:06,423 --> 00:11:08,640
Sir, can we meet the SHO?
- There's no use meeting him.

191
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,827
Go and mind your own business.

192
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,644
Who the nuts are they?

193
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:13,974
We will do one thing.

194
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:16,869
You should never write your PIN
number on your ATM card.

195
00:11:17,015 --> 00:11:19,035
Where is the card that you
took last week?

196
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:20,356
Let me look!
- Joy, sir.

197
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:23,164
You remember, the 'Premam'
piracy case?

198
00:11:23,244 --> 00:11:24,103
Yes.

199
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,019
It seems, our findings on
the case wasn't correct.

200
00:11:27,183 --> 00:11:28,186
Who said it?

201
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:29,849
Those guys standing over there.

202
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:32,016
What did you say your name is?
- Antony.

203
00:11:33,362 --> 00:11:35,058
And you?
- Vinay Dasan.

204
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,572
Vinay Das...

205
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:38,641
What do you do, Vinay Das?

206
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:42,224
Are you jobless?

207
00:11:42,378 --> 00:11:43,478
I'm employed.

208
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:45,478
I work as a courier boy.

209
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:46,933
Blue Cart in Kochi.

210
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:51,193
What about you?
- I'm preparing for bank exams.

211
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:53,564
Meanwhile, I work part-time
in 'chicking'.

212
00:11:53,856 --> 00:11:54,901
B-tech graduate, huh?

213
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,859
Yes, Computer Science.

214
00:11:56,939 --> 00:11:59,768
So, what these B-tech graduates
are saying, is that,

215
00:11:59,848 --> 00:12:02,523
our findings in Premam Piracy
case is wrong.

216
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:05,106
Sorry sir, that's not it.

217
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:07,273
Then, what else, sir?

218
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:09,734
Well, they are youngsters.

219
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:11,234
They might want to act in films.

220
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,068
If they can make friends
with Anwar Rasheed in this name,

221
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:14,776
they may get a minor
role in his next film.

222
00:12:14,856 --> 00:12:16,231
What else?

223
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:18,841
Anyway, isn't this case about
that woman?

224
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:21,068
Yes.
- Let me see what she is saying.

225
00:12:21,148 --> 00:12:23,231
Simply, to create a controversy,
what else?

226
00:12:23,314 --> 00:12:25,276
There's no controversy behind this.

227
00:12:25,356 --> 00:12:27,314
And you needn't try to
make one out of this.

228
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:28,898
On 29th of May.

229
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,012
On the first day of release
of Premam, at 2.10 pm,

230
00:12:32,092 --> 00:12:34,939
someone uploaded the print on
the website of Tamil Rockers.

231
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:37,689
That's the main course of spread.

232
00:12:42,523 --> 00:12:44,984
The police had seized the prints
from the CD outlets in Chennai,

233
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,337
on the very day itself.

234
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:52,564
They have also tracked the agents
who supply the prints to them.

235
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:55,540
I don't know, sir.

236
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,193
I swear, I don't know anything
about it.

237
00:12:57,273 --> 00:13:00,295
Through them, we have also arrested
an admin of Tamil Rockers.

238
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,107
Sir, let us go. We don't
know anything.

239
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:04,398
After cross-questioning them,
we understood that,

240
00:13:05,023 --> 00:13:06,984
It was a guy in New Zealand,

241
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:09,023
who uploaded it on
the Tamil Rockers website.

242
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:13,672
It's not legally possible either to
catch the guy in New Zealand,

243
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,439
or to question him.

244
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:18,151
Because piracy is not a
crime in New Zealand.

245
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:22,314
Sir, the print was not uploaded
on the Tamil Rockers website, first.

246
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:24,609
Then?

247
00:13:24,689 --> 00:13:27,231
Just a day before, the print
was available on U torrent.

248
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:28,859
The file that appeared
in Tamil Rockers,

249
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:30,568
was initially downloaded
from there earlier.

250
00:13:30,648 --> 00:13:34,148
Because both the copies contained
the water mark from Censor Board.

251
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,401
Sir, we had this project
while doing B-tech.

252
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:38,234
It is called Metadata analysing.

253
00:13:38,314 --> 00:13:40,541
By using it,
we can get the details of each,

254
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:42,043
and every file uploaded
on the internet.

255
00:13:42,123 --> 00:13:46,606
Details like the time the file has
been uploaded, its size, and so on.

256
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:47,540
So?

257
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,775
Sir, there were
six files altogether.

258
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:52,898
Its size was 960 Mb.

259
00:13:52,978 --> 00:13:54,818
The total time taken to
upload the file of size,

260
00:13:54,898 --> 00:13:58,773
960 Mb on internet is
one hour fifty minutes.

261
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:01,276
Okay.
- Which means 110 minutes.

262
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:05,526
I.e., in one minute, 8.72 Mb
of data is being transferred.

263
00:14:05,606 --> 00:14:08,577
So, it's just 0.14 Mb in one second.

264
00:14:08,657 --> 00:14:12,719
Sir, this 0.14 mbps is the average
net speed of BSNL network,

265
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,148
in a rural area inside Kerala.

266
00:14:14,314 --> 00:14:15,484
So, most probably,

267
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,523
the file must have been uploaded
in Kerala.

268
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:19,734
Basheer.
- Yes, sir.

269
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,222
Ask Joshy sir, to come over.

270
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:22,321
Sir, the file please.

271
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,606
Lissy, I'm in an urgent meeting.
I'll call you back.

272
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:29,193
Sir,

273
00:14:29,273 --> 00:14:31,106
This is what we were talking about.
- Sir, please check it.

274
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:37,151
On 28th of May, at 11.25pm,

275
00:14:37,231 --> 00:14:40,481
i.e. the day before 'Premam'
was released...

276
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:44,023
The censor copy of this movie
was uploaded on U torrent.

277
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:48,234
Well, we can find out the IP address
based on the uploaded content.

278
00:14:48,314 --> 00:14:50,443
And we can check if their
findings are genuine.

279
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:51,943
That is the protocol.

280
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:54,818
Well, sir, I'm not sure if U Torrent
would provide the IP address.

281
00:14:54,898 --> 00:14:56,984
Well, we can request
them for the IP address,

282
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,526
via government authorities
sighting the case requirements.

283
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:00,526
Am I right?

284
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:02,273
It will take time, Peter.

285
00:15:02,398 --> 00:15:04,151
But sir, even if we find out...

286
00:15:04,231 --> 00:15:06,901
If they have uploaded
it using a proxy server,

287
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:08,865
the IP address that
we might get,

288
00:15:08,998 --> 00:15:11,023
would be from... Say
Africa or Nigeria.

289
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:15,856
Sir, they have uploaded it under
the name, 'Hero'.

290
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:17,443
When we searched for it,

291
00:15:17,523 --> 00:15:20,856
the profile picture used
was that of a dog.

292
00:15:21,314 --> 00:15:23,859
There are seven files in the
uploaded folder.

293
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:27,689
Six of them are the mp4 files
of the film, Premam.

294
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:29,356
And one is a word file.

295
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:32,276
Isn't it a blank file?

296
00:15:32,356 --> 00:15:33,856
What are we going to do with this?

297
00:15:35,428 --> 00:15:37,720
Sir, when you create a word file,

298
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,290
the user name of
the corresponding system will,

299
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,523
appear in the property list
of the word file as author name.

300
00:15:46,981 --> 00:15:48,901
Sir, if so,

301
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:52,606
it is the owner of the system who
has uploaded the files on the internet.

302
00:15:53,398 --> 00:15:54,481
Baburaj.

303
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:58,023
A guy named Baburaj is
surely related to this case.

304
00:15:59,898 --> 00:16:01,901
Either the word file was
uploaded by mistake,

305
00:16:01,981 --> 00:16:03,568
while dragging the others,

306
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:06,439
or it was done on purpose
by someone.

307
00:16:06,814 --> 00:16:08,901
But we need to find this Baburaj,

308
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:11,231
to get a clearer
picture of the case.

309
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:13,984
Then, why don't we line-up everyone
named Baburaj in Kerala,

310
00:16:14,064 --> 00:16:15,356
and question them?

311
00:16:15,523 --> 00:16:17,359
Dear sir, where on earth
are we going to find him?

312
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:19,934
Well sir, first,
we have to find out if Baburaj is,

313
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:22,068
anyone inside the
crew list of Premam.

314
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,568
So, we must cross-question
all the technicians in the film,

315
00:16:24,648 --> 00:16:26,043
including the director.

316
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:31,023
Premam Piracy Case interrogations
at a turning point.

317
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:38,689
Hello.

318
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:40,234
Sir, just ten minutes.

319
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:41,359
I'm taking the list.

320
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:43,064
Please check the crew list.

321
00:16:49,564 --> 00:16:51,234
Sir, there's a mail from
Vismaya studio.

322
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:52,280
Yes, I'm checking it.

323
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,901
There's no technician named
Baburaj in Vismaya studio.

324
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,498
Sir, this is the list
of Censor board employees,

325
00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:58,023
who handled the film, 'Premam'.

326
00:16:58,193 --> 00:16:59,774
'Film censoring has been stalled...'
- No one called Baburaj is here.

327
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:01,109
'...until Monday
as a protest against,'

328
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:03,080
'unnecessarily dragging censor board
Employees,' - Who is Baburaj?

329
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,232
'in the Premam Piracy Case.'
- Sir, the Film Chamber office?

330
00:17:04,312 --> 00:17:05,155
Upstairs!

331
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:09,439
Are you here?
- I'm here, here...

332
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:12,609
This is a directory I collected
from the Film Chamber.

333
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:14,374
It contains the numbers of all the
technicians in the industry.

334
00:17:14,454 --> 00:17:15,359
Okay, check it.

335
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,023
Sir, it was me who took the hard
disc to Vismaya for dubbing.

336
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:23,359
Hello, Baburaj.
- 'Hello.'

337
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,359
I'm Salam, art technician.

338
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,859
'Which Salam?'
- Where are you?

339
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,359
I'm in between a shooting.
- 'Which movie?'

340
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,444
'Why do you want to know?
Who are you?'

341
00:17:30,524 --> 00:17:32,106
Salam! Salam!
- 'Which Salam?'

342
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:34,398
'Check for the correct number
before calling, you dumbo.'

343
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:36,984
I have been assisting Anwar for
the past two years.

344
00:17:37,064 --> 00:17:39,359
Both Anand and Alphones
use to come to Di suit.

345
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:40,693
By 12.30 pm, noon,

346
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:44,091
the Cyber cops reached the
Alphones Puthran's flat in Aluva.

347
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,943
We were sure the movie
would go well in the theatres.

348
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:49,689
But we never expected such
a blow in between.

349
00:17:50,064 --> 00:17:52,651
A lot of people within our industry
don't want our film do well.

350
00:17:52,731 --> 00:17:53,930
Its common in the film industry.

351
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:57,857
Buddy,

352
00:17:57,937 --> 00:18:00,401
if there's anything true about
what online media has been saying,

353
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:02,859
Thiruvananthapuram lobby has
a role in this piracy case,

354
00:18:02,939 --> 00:18:05,234
so that the film doesn't
enter into the five hundred million club.

355
00:18:05,314 --> 00:18:07,207
Do we have to think along that line?
- Why not?

356
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:08,767
If it is so,

357
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:10,818
we need to take the details of
seven people named Baburaj,

358
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:13,023
who have a connection with the
Thiruvananthapuram lobby.

359
00:18:13,273 --> 00:18:14,609
Out of seven guys named Baburaj,

360
00:18:14,689 --> 00:18:16,943
only three of them are active
in the industry right now.

361
00:18:17,023 --> 00:18:18,624
I have taken the call list
of all the three.

362
00:18:18,704 --> 00:18:21,734
One among them called
Priyadarsan several times,

363
00:18:21,814 --> 00:18:24,898
on May 26th, 27th and 28th.

364
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,064
Sir.
- One Mr Baburaj Kalliath.

365
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,693
He's a native of Thiruvananthapuram.

366
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:31,943
He has received one and a half lakh
rupees via bank transfer from,

367
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:33,543
Priyadarshan's production house.

368
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:36,314
That too on May 29th, the very
day, Premam was released.

369
00:18:37,773 --> 00:18:40,109
Will we go behind bars for this?
- Why are you standing here?

370
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:42,231
Joy sir asked us to wait here.

371
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:43,734
Do you know the IME number?

372
00:18:43,814 --> 00:18:45,831
It's from Priyadarshan's studio,

373
00:18:45,911 --> 00:18:48,231
the final copy has
gone for censoring.

374
00:18:48,939 --> 00:18:51,858
Moreover, there is a rumour
among the fans,

375
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:55,068
that there are some guys
playing in the film industry,

376
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:57,231
not to break the 500 million
record of the film, Drishyam,

377
00:18:57,564 --> 00:18:59,606
When all of these
are put together,

378
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,398
the game is clear. Isn't it, sir?

379
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:07,192
But how do we go about it without
informing the top authorities?

380
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,117
It will take a hell of a time if we
inform the authorities.

381
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:10,856
Sir, this is an opportunity.

382
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:33,953
Get into the car!

383
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:40,784
Aneesh, did you call anyone
over there?

384
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:42,748
I have spoken to Anoop
from Thiruvananthapuram wing.

385
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:44,879
What did Anoop say?
- His number is still active.

386
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:47,591
At times it says, switched off,
might be network issues.

387
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:49,703
Sir, he's in
Thiruvananthapuram for sure.

388
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,760
We are from the Cyber Cell.

389
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,194
Baburaj Sir,

390
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,415
we have been trying to get you
on call right from the morning.

391
00:20:09,495 --> 00:20:11,537
It's either out of range
or switched off.

392
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:14,732
There's enough range. It
shows all the signal bars.

393
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:17,015
You got a password?

394
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:18,164
Tell me your password.

395
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:20,123
1,2...

396
00:20:20,203 --> 00:20:21,662
3,4,5,6.

397
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:22,915
Listen,

398
00:20:22,995 --> 00:20:25,498
you should collect all the available
data base from the cabins here.

399
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:27,496
Why do you want to search my stuff?
- He will tell you.

400
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:29,253
We are here to know
two things in particular.

401
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,325
Oh, really?

402
00:20:30,405 --> 00:20:33,045
Firstly, on 26, 27, 28th of May…

403
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:36,009
To be accurate, three days
before Premam was released.

404
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:39,509
You have been talking to director
Priyadarshan on the phone.

405
00:20:39,589 --> 00:20:40,926
What were you guys discussing?

406
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:43,339
Secondly, on 29th May,

407
00:20:43,506 --> 00:20:45,029
One and a half lakh of rupees,

408
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:48,089
have been credited to your bank
account from Priyadarshan.

409
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,180
What's it for?

410
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,134
Wasn't I Priyan sir's assistant
for long?

411
00:20:51,214 --> 00:20:53,381
Awesome! Are you asking us?

412
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:55,093
Yes, I am.

413
00:20:55,283 --> 00:20:57,423
I have been with him since the film,
'Thenmaavinkombathu.'

414
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,134
So, sir...he's the guy
we are looking for.

415
00:21:00,214 --> 00:21:02,218
Is there any problem with
Thenmaavinkombathu?

416
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:05,051
Chaps like you always do cheesy
stuff to trouble top authorities.

417
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:07,051
What's this all about, sir?
- It's just what you see.

418
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:08,246
Don't they have soft copies
of the same?

419
00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:09,759
Sorry! I don't...
- Where's the bank statement?

420
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,134
Not this, back, back...

421
00:21:11,318 --> 00:21:12,673
Just open the folder.

422
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,634
So, you have pretty good
dealings with Priyadarsan.

423
00:21:16,714 --> 00:21:18,093
Obviously, he taught me cinema.

424
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:19,343
We talk very often.

425
00:21:19,423 --> 00:21:22,464
When he comes to Thiruvananthapuram,
I meet him at hotel Pankaj.

426
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,503
What about the 1.5 lakhs
credited to your account?

427
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,551
Sir, you know it, Priyan sir
does a lot of Ads.

428
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:28,884
At times, he gives me Ads
to help my both ends meet.

429
00:21:28,964 --> 00:21:30,801
I got the one and a half lakh as
an advance for an Ad.

430
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:32,051
I have proof.

431
00:21:32,131 --> 00:21:33,384
Sir, please check them.

432
00:21:33,464 --> 00:21:35,259
Geez! A lot of proofs, huh?
Let me see.

433
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:37,389
This is not data
but devotional songs,

434
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:38,426
of mother Goddess'.

435
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,819
Let me check it, sir.

436
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,631
Here's your phone.

437
00:21:43,673 --> 00:21:44,843
Is it your own building?

438
00:21:44,923 --> 00:21:46,426
Yes, I got it as dowry.

439
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:49,093
Dowry, huh?
- Nope, no dowry.

440
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:51,051
I meant to say her share
of her father's property.

441
00:21:51,131 --> 00:21:52,673
This is not going to end
anywhere here, okay?

442
00:21:53,135 --> 00:21:55,356
Sir, we got it wrong.

443
00:21:58,673 --> 00:21:59,843
How ridiculous!

444
00:21:59,923 --> 00:22:02,134
From now on, I'm not doing
this anymore.

445
00:22:02,214 --> 00:22:04,131
Just to spoil the name
of our department.

446
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:07,714
Thiruvananthapuram lobby,
Cochin lobby... his mom's...

447
00:22:07,923 --> 00:22:09,051
Leave it, Basheer.

448
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:11,631
Sir, we needn't blindly
trust Baburaj.

449
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:13,384
Let's keep an eye on him
for a couple of days.

450
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:14,718
Sure, we will get something.

451
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:16,634
Dear Aneesh, what's there
to monitor him so much?

452
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:18,343
We have searched his office,
say every nook and corner.

453
00:22:18,423 --> 00:22:20,051
Also, cross checked
every single file.

454
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:22,134
Can't you understand from
his face that he's a coward?

455
00:22:22,214 --> 00:22:23,051
I was just saying, sir.

456
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:24,051
Moreover...

457
00:22:24,131 --> 00:22:26,634
Is Kerala Police a puppet
in the hands of random guys?

458
00:22:26,714 --> 00:22:28,343
Everything has a protocol.
- Sir, this is...

459
00:22:28,423 --> 00:22:29,673
You bloody...

460
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:32,673
You mustn't say anything
that you don't know.

461
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:36,714
In Kerala, we (Police) spend our
own money for such missions.

462
00:22:36,908 --> 00:22:40,006
We haven't yet got reimbursement
for the earlier missions, either.

463
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:41,923
In between all this, you're
here with your antics.

464
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:44,756
Sir, we just said we were
suspicious of him.

465
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:46,509
Sorry, sir.

466
00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:49,093
Hey kiddo, don't try
to justify yourself.

467
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:50,884
Come on, leave it.

468
00:22:50,964 --> 00:22:52,926
This is quite common in
a case investigation.

469
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:54,259
We will find other ways.

470
00:22:54,434 --> 00:22:56,506
My dear, sir, please keep
your mouth shut.

471
00:22:57,339 --> 00:22:58,631
Crap!

472
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:02,593
Sir, we shall get down here.

473
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,301
Hey, come on, are you going
because you felt bad?

474
00:23:04,381 --> 00:23:06,420
No, not at all.
- Then what?

475
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,926
You're going to Kochi, right?
Get in.

476
00:23:08,006 --> 00:23:09,343
Hey, get in, Dasan.

477
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:11,173
We have some other
plans, that's why...

478
00:23:11,464 --> 00:23:14,259
What plans? This is a lame
excuse. Just get in, guys.

479
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:16,714
That's not it, sir. Let's go.
We will call you.

480
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:19,256
Sorry sir.
Bye.

481
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:21,551
How will you go?
- We will go by bus.

482
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:22,964
Hey.
- Yes.

483
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:24,937
Where's the balance money?

484
00:23:25,381 --> 00:23:27,589
What balance?
- Balance money of tea.

485
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:29,714
Oh, my goodness!!

486
00:23:30,673 --> 00:23:31,909
I swear I forgot about it.

487
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:33,173
Okay.

488
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:38,759
What's wrong with you, Basheer?

489
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,093
They are kids, aren't they?

490
00:23:40,173 --> 00:23:41,559
Chill, sir.

491
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:43,964
We should never over
entertain such guys.

492
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,759
'The Cyber Cell is baffled,'

493
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:50,426
'as they haven't got any clue
regarding the origin of censor copy,'

494
00:23:50,506 --> 00:23:53,131
'from the raid conducted at
offices of various film people.'

495
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:58,506
I am fed up, man.

496
00:23:58,777 --> 00:24:00,131
I quit.

497
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:02,339
How long have we
been after this?

498
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:03,801
Nothing's going to work out.

499
00:24:03,881 --> 00:24:05,384
Just to have them
swear at us.

500
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:07,676
Close it, and keep it
somewhere far.

501
00:24:07,756 --> 00:24:10,249
Engineer sir, do one thing.

502
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:12,134
Have a bath every morning,

503
00:24:12,214 --> 00:24:14,256
wear your Blue Cart's uniform
and start begging.

504
00:24:14,381 --> 00:24:15,509
What else should we do?

505
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:17,072
Is anyone giving us
a full time job?

506
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,548
But, is it possible to survive with
part-time jobs?

507
00:24:21,464 --> 00:24:23,676
How long since we have
passed engineering?

508
00:24:23,756 --> 00:24:25,214
Do we have a good job?

509
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,926
See this, it's her message.

510
00:24:28,006 --> 00:24:30,426
She's asking me to go
and speak to her dad.

511
00:24:30,506 --> 00:24:32,173
What should I tell him?

512
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,798
Give it to me.

513
00:24:37,464 --> 00:24:39,214
We should prove something.

514
00:24:39,756 --> 00:24:42,673
Not to others, but for
our sake, at least.

515
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:45,089
We must find him.

516
00:24:45,548 --> 00:24:47,964
Don't try to make me
feel worthless, okay?

517
00:24:48,631 --> 00:24:50,051
What you need is Baburaj, right?

518
00:24:50,131 --> 00:24:51,548
Wait and watch.

519
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:54,381
We should have looked for Baburaj
on Facebook earlier itself.

520
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:57,256
Let me check how many people
named Baburaj are there on this.

521
00:24:57,423 --> 00:24:59,339
We will list it out and find him.

522
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,464
List out how many of them
are related to cinema.

523
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:04,714
No one is going to hide anywhere.

524
00:25:05,423 --> 00:25:07,756
Hey, just scroll back.

525
00:25:09,131 --> 00:25:10,631
This one?
- Yes.

526
00:25:13,714 --> 00:25:15,259
Isn't it that dog?

527
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:16,631
Yes, it is.

528
00:25:17,006 --> 00:25:18,089
Show me the photo.

529
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:19,884
See this.

530
00:25:19,964 --> 00:25:21,589
Isn't it the same dog?

531
00:25:21,673 --> 00:25:24,214
Yes, both the dogs look alike.

532
00:25:24,464 --> 00:25:27,089
It was copied from this.

533
00:25:27,506 --> 00:25:30,048
See which place he belongs to?
- This is not a fake account.

534
00:25:30,214 --> 00:25:31,714
This is an original account.

535
00:25:32,006 --> 00:25:35,506
He's a KSRTC driver in Kazarkode.

536
00:25:35,674 --> 00:25:37,653
Come on.

537
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:39,884
Buddy, you inform Joice sir, about it.

538
00:25:39,964 --> 00:25:41,923
Shut your mouth, and
come on fast.

539
00:25:43,735 --> 00:25:45,881
Anyway, I won't be able
to go home today.

540
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:49,551
Mom, I'm taking this Chit money
for the time being. - Antony.

541
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:50,968
Hey, give it back.
- I'll give it to you next week.

542
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:53,011
No, I must pay it urgently.
- Mom, pay you next week.

543
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:54,589
What will I say when they
come to collect the money?

544
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:56,551
He finds penny lying
outside, and he takes it!

545
00:25:56,631 --> 00:25:58,006
Enough! I'm keeping it back.

546
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:02,551
I have put five hundred back; I'll pay
the balance next week.

547
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:04,718
Have food and go.
- No, I'll eat later.

548
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:06,134
Eat and go, I say.

549
00:26:06,214 --> 00:26:07,676
Where are you both going
at midnight?

550
00:26:07,756 --> 00:26:10,426
We have work. - If it is for
cigarettes, I'll burn you alive.

551
00:26:10,506 --> 00:26:12,620
Are you wearing my slippers?
- I'm to blame for cooking them food.

552
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:14,301
Man, does your mom light
cigarettes on a burner?

553
00:26:14,381 --> 00:26:16,301
Eat and go, I say.
- We will eat after coming back.

554
00:26:16,381 --> 00:26:17,464
Get lost.

555
00:26:17,544 --> 00:26:18,426
Come on, dude!

556
00:26:18,506 --> 00:26:20,132
I'm asking you,
where are you going?

557
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:22,426
Tell her, dear. - Dasan, tell me
where are you going?

558
00:26:22,506 --> 00:26:24,381
We're going nearby...
just till Kazakode.

559
00:26:24,923 --> 00:26:26,631
Kazarkode, huh?

560
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:33,048
KAZARKODE - 83 kms.

561
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:38,593
'The bus departing this morning
from Kazarkode...'

562
00:26:38,673 --> 00:26:40,426
Sister, is there anyone named
Baburaj here?

563
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:42,051
Yes, he is a driver.

564
00:26:42,131 --> 00:26:44,339
Driver...? Where is he right now?

565
00:26:44,756 --> 00:26:46,426
He's gone to Neeleshwaram for duty.

566
00:26:46,506 --> 00:26:47,593
He'll be back by 8.30.

567
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:49,134
Is he Baburaj Thomas?

568
00:26:49,214 --> 00:26:51,964
Yes, the one with a long beard.
- Yes, yes, thanks, sister.

569
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:00,134
He works here.

570
00:27:00,214 --> 00:27:02,093
There's a Neeleshwaram bus,
reaching here at 8.30.

571
00:27:02,173 --> 00:27:03,589
He is the driver of the bus.

572
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,094
Please give me a bottle of water.

573
00:27:21,546 --> 00:27:27,503
'The bus from Kazarkode to
Mangalore will depart shortly.'

574
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:42,718
A bus to Uppalam
has been parked in,

575
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:44,426
the southern side of
the bus station.'

576
00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:46,009
Sir, has the bus to
Bandadka come?

577
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:47,464
8.15.
- Okay.

578
00:27:58,287 --> 00:28:00,131
Hey! Antony.

579
00:28:15,589 --> 00:28:17,089
Hi, Satheesh.
- Hi, Babu.

580
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:19,301
The tyres have worn out.
Change it.

581
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:20,968
Buy booze in the evening.

582
00:28:21,048 --> 00:28:22,798
You must buy it, idiot.
- Evening...for sure.

583
00:28:33,214 --> 00:28:34,426
Come on, quick.

584
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,839
Where is he?

585
00:28:41,964 --> 00:28:43,756
You go to the other side.

586
00:28:53,323 --> 00:28:54,218
Dasan.

587
00:28:55,464 --> 00:28:56,464
Come here.

588
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:02,964
What is it?

589
00:29:03,464 --> 00:29:05,301
Here, here, here...
He is inside.

590
00:29:05,381 --> 00:29:06,506
Inside this room?

591
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:25,631
Who are you?

592
00:29:25,714 --> 00:29:27,381
Are you not Baburaj?

593
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,798
What do you want?

594
00:29:29,173 --> 00:29:31,381
Brother, we have been searching for you.

595
00:29:31,589 --> 00:29:33,839
We have got all the details
of your Facebook account.

596
00:29:33,923 --> 00:29:35,468
What nonsense are you saying?

597
00:29:35,548 --> 00:29:36,884
Brother, just take a look at it.

598
00:29:36,964 --> 00:29:39,298
Isn't it your Facebook profile?
- Which one?

599
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:41,801
My dear friend, see this.

600
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:43,634
I know only this.

601
00:29:43,714 --> 00:29:45,509
I don't even have Facebook with me.

602
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:46,595
Then, how will you collect details,

603
00:29:46,675 --> 00:29:47,968
of my Facebook which
doesn't even exist?

604
00:29:48,048 --> 00:29:50,134
If so, who uploaded the
print of Premam?

605
00:29:50,214 --> 00:29:52,051
This will become a police
case, tell us the truth.

606
00:29:52,131 --> 00:29:53,676
Don't give me a headache, buddy.

607
00:29:53,756 --> 00:29:55,551
Don't go, tell us the truth.
- There's no need to argue.

608
00:29:55,631 --> 00:29:57,593
Tomorrow, the police will come and
you will have to answer them.

609
00:29:57,673 --> 00:29:59,214
Police?
- Yes, why not?

610
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,843
It's a piracy case.
You will go behind bars.

611
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:01,884
Piracy, huh?

612
00:30:01,964 --> 00:30:03,676
If you're this adamant,

613
00:30:03,756 --> 00:30:05,756
the police will come, and this
will go out of your hands.

614
00:30:05,923 --> 00:30:07,259
You photo will come in the
newspapers. - Get lost.

615
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:09,009
Yes, you will lose your
job right away.

616
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:10,968
Just get lost, you... I'm not
the type you think I am.

617
00:30:11,048 --> 00:30:13,506
Brother, brother, brother...
See this.

618
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:15,134
Is it not your dog?

619
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:16,589
This one?

620
00:30:17,631 --> 00:30:19,048
He is our Tomy.

621
00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:21,714
I have a sister in Varkala.

622
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:23,551
It is her dog.

623
00:30:23,631 --> 00:30:24,631
Tomy.

624
00:30:26,756 --> 00:30:28,673
Her name is Sisily.

625
00:30:28,756 --> 00:30:30,548
She is a PWD clerk.

626
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:35,343
My brother-in-law was in the Gulf.

627
00:30:35,423 --> 00:30:36,384
Now, he is here.

628
00:30:36,464 --> 00:30:37,464
Pious.

629
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,718
We are not on good terms.

630
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:46,089
Property issues.

631
00:31:01,548 --> 00:31:03,093
They have a son.

632
00:31:03,173 --> 00:31:05,382
He's a brat studying
in Varkala, VHSC.

633
00:31:05,462 --> 00:31:07,218
Jerry.
- What is it, sir?

634
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:08,812
What's the problem?

635
00:31:08,988 --> 00:31:11,108
Is there anything wrong?
- Why do you want to call him?

636
00:31:11,188 --> 00:31:13,763
What's the matter, sir.
- Hey, come here.

637
00:31:14,576 --> 00:31:16,124
Come.
- What is it, son?

638
00:31:16,643 --> 00:31:19,274
Don't stare like an
ostrich, come here, kid.

639
00:31:19,354 --> 00:31:20,645
What is the issue, sir?

640
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:23,319
Come on.

641
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,718
Come on, kid.
- You had us eat our brains out.

642
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:27,851
Sit here.

643
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,635
Sit here.

644
00:31:31,051 --> 00:31:32,841
What's it, sir?
What's the problem?

645
00:31:33,154 --> 00:31:34,324
Is there anything wrong?

646
00:31:34,404 --> 00:31:36,654
Of course, that's why we are
here at this late hour.

647
00:31:36,948 --> 00:31:38,157
Isn't it, kid?

648
00:31:38,237 --> 00:31:39,811
Do you want to speak,
or shall I go?

649
00:31:39,891 --> 00:31:43,779
Well, don't you know your son has
started a new business?

650
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:45,446
He is earning a lot,

651
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,414
by uploading new films
on the internet.

652
00:31:47,494 --> 00:31:48,487
Isn't it?

653
00:31:51,404 --> 00:31:52,946
Where is your laptop, kiddo?

654
00:31:53,071 --> 00:31:54,282
Sir, that must be there
in his room.

655
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:55,696
I'll go take it.

656
00:32:06,612 --> 00:32:07,821
What is the password?

657
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:13,029
What is the password?

658
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:18,237
It is 'motherf**ker1...

659
00:32:18,427 --> 00:32:19,423
What is it?

660
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,529
'motherf**ker123'

661
00:32:23,904 --> 00:32:25,029
Mother...

662
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:29,737
Did you create a Facebook
account in your uncle's name?

663
00:32:30,154 --> 00:32:30,991
Tell me.

664
00:32:31,071 --> 00:32:33,616
Do you know about the illegal
things your son is doing,

665
00:32:33,696 --> 00:32:36,029
by creating a fake ID in the
name of your brother?

666
00:32:36,696 --> 00:32:38,779
Why is Jerry angry
with your uncle?

667
00:32:41,321 --> 00:32:43,529
My parents don't like him.

668
00:32:44,112 --> 00:32:46,529
Mom has asked me not
to speak with him.

669
00:32:47,154 --> 00:32:48,737
Didn't you hear what
your son just said?

670
00:32:51,817 --> 00:32:53,699
Basheer, what's with it?

671
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:56,154
Sir, I can't find anything.

672
00:32:57,321 --> 00:32:58,532
Where is the print?

673
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:00,577
It is there in the hidden files.

674
00:33:00,657 --> 00:33:03,321
Sir, shall I...?

675
00:33:04,196 --> 00:33:06,154
Let me do it.
- Basheer, let him give it a try.

676
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:09,071
Then, you try, kiddo.

677
00:33:18,571 --> 00:33:20,529
I have already searched all of them.

678
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:35,112
All are learning material, huh?

679
00:33:35,237 --> 00:33:37,612
You love biology, don't you?

680
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:39,404
You are smart.

681
00:33:39,946 --> 00:33:42,487
Sir, all the files are in here.

682
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:49,665
'Stop chatting! Just go!'

683
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,446
Wherefrom did you get the print?

684
00:33:53,571 --> 00:33:55,404
Come on, open your
mouth and tell us.

685
00:33:55,561 --> 00:33:56,694
Don't hurt him, sir.

686
00:33:56,862 --> 00:33:57,987
Tell me, son.

687
00:33:58,612 --> 00:33:59,781
Keep it.
- Sir,

688
00:33:59,861 --> 00:34:01,779
See, we are taking him along.

689
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:05,347
Joy, come to Varkala station
tomorrow, early morning.

690
00:34:05,596 --> 00:34:07,830
We will get him to confess
before that.

691
00:34:08,826 --> 00:34:10,337
He would have done
it by mistake.

692
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:12,737
Please don't take him now.
He is a kid.

693
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:15,782
Tell us, what's the problem?
- Don't take him now, please, sir.

694
00:34:15,862 --> 00:34:17,157
Sir, I'll bring
him tomorrow morning.

695
00:34:17,237 --> 00:34:19,438
He is a kid; he must have...
- Joy, move out of our way.

696
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:20,991
Move.
- Sir, he is a school-going kid.

697
00:34:21,071 --> 00:34:22,657
Please sir, please don't
take him now.

698
00:34:22,737 --> 00:34:24,574
Sir, I'll do as you say.

699
00:34:24,654 --> 00:34:25,741
You come along with me.

700
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,237
Don't be scared.

701
00:34:28,017 --> 00:34:29,077
Don't hurt him, sir.

702
00:34:29,157 --> 00:34:32,321
If you co-operate with us,
you will have no problem at all.

703
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,029
Why are you complicating
things?

704
00:34:36,446 --> 00:34:37,824
Aren't you a kid?

705
00:34:37,904 --> 00:34:40,779
Do you know what will happen
if you go to jail at your age?

706
00:34:40,904 --> 00:34:42,487
Your life will be spoiled.

707
00:34:43,237 --> 00:34:45,112
Do you know why we came
at night?

708
00:34:45,404 --> 00:34:48,862
To solve the issue without the
media and the public knowing.

709
00:34:49,612 --> 00:34:52,587
If you are this adamant,
how is it possible?

710
00:34:53,362 --> 00:34:55,157
That will not work.
Tell me the truth.

711
00:34:55,237 --> 00:34:57,571
We will take care of you.

712
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:58,974
You will have no problem at all.

713
00:34:59,054 --> 00:35:01,112
You just tell us who
gave it to you.

714
00:35:02,654 --> 00:35:04,324
Son, tell me.
Don't get tense.

715
00:35:04,404 --> 00:35:05,612
Tell me the truth.

716
00:35:05,821 --> 00:35:07,154
Who gave it to you?

717
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:09,112
Anjali gave it to me.

718
00:35:10,737 --> 00:35:11,904
Which Anjali?

719
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:15,571
She is my classmate.

720
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:17,366
I got it from her.

721
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,279
But how? Tell me.

722
00:35:19,446 --> 00:35:20,865
We have been in love since 8th grade.

723
00:35:20,945 --> 00:35:22,366
Eh? Since what grade?

724
00:35:22,446 --> 00:35:24,237
Sir, eighth grade.

725
00:35:27,071 --> 00:35:30,904
She had a few photos of
our tenth class reunion.

726
00:35:31,321 --> 00:35:33,321
I took the pen drive from her
to copy those pictures.

727
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:36,741
I found the print of Premam
inside a folder.

728
00:35:36,821 --> 00:35:38,654
How did the print get
into the pen drive?

729
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:41,449
I asked her once that,

730
00:35:41,529 --> 00:35:43,987
how did she get the print of
an unreleased movie?

731
00:35:44,529 --> 00:35:46,366
She said she would tell me later,

732
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:47,946
and asked me not to tell anyone.

733
00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:52,237
Sir, she is a nice girl.

734
00:36:19,987 --> 00:36:21,820
Do you have the print of
Premam with you?

735
00:36:25,237 --> 00:36:27,116
I know you have it
in the pen drive.

736
00:36:27,196 --> 00:36:29,071
I'm here at the back seat.

737
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:38,946
We are police.
Vishnu is under our custody.

738
00:36:47,404 --> 00:36:50,362
We know that you leaked
the print of Premam.

739
00:37:17,298 --> 00:37:18,923
Anjali C.

740
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:23,383
How did the video get into the pen
drive that you gave to Jerry?

741
00:37:24,106 --> 00:37:25,544
I don't know anything, sir.

742
00:37:25,624 --> 00:37:29,090
We have not yet informed
either your parents or the school.

743
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,649
We didn't even bring
a lady cop just because,

744
00:37:30,729 --> 00:37:32,134
we didn't want to
make trouble for you.

745
00:37:32,214 --> 00:37:33,127
I don't know anything.
- Tell me, girl,

746
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:34,021
wherefrom did you get it?

747
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:35,716
If not, this vehicle
will go straight,

748
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:37,304
to Kallambalam police station.

749
00:37:37,384 --> 00:37:39,086
This is not the way the
police would question there.

750
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,801
Sir, please don't say like that.

751
00:37:40,881 --> 00:37:42,381
She might have done
it unwittingly.

752
00:37:42,464 --> 00:37:43,756
She's a good girl.

753
00:37:44,025 --> 00:37:45,634
Please don't cry, Anjali.

754
00:37:45,788 --> 00:37:47,435
Stop crying, first.

755
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:48,964
Anjali, speak out.

756
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:51,548
My lover gave it to me.

757
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,509
No, I'm not the one
who gave it to her.

758
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:55,135
She gave it to me.

759
00:37:56,779 --> 00:37:57,756
Tell us, kiddie.

760
00:37:58,682 --> 00:38:00,964
Is he the one who gave it to you?
- Not him.

761
00:38:01,344 --> 00:38:03,093
Then?
- Akhilesh.

762
00:38:03,403 --> 00:38:04,301
What?

763
00:38:04,638 --> 00:38:05,881
Akhilesh?

764
00:38:07,748 --> 00:38:09,131
Who is Akhilesh?

765
00:38:09,558 --> 00:38:11,955
He is a system operator
at the censor board.

766
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,339
Where is your Akhilesh right now?

767
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:21,173
He said he lives somewhere
near Poonthura colony.

768
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:25,673
I don't know anything else, sir.

769
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,343
'This is a case, and it has
its seriousness.'

770
00:38:37,423 --> 00:38:39,801
'Police is no Childs play.
It needs a lot of effort.'

771
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:41,468
'It's about taking up
a lot of tension.'

772
00:38:41,548 --> 00:38:44,023
'Why would I send a low quality
censor copy to someone,'

773
00:38:44,103 --> 00:38:45,656
'from my system?'

774
00:38:45,736 --> 00:38:46,756
'Am I crazy?'

775
00:38:50,423 --> 00:38:51,839
Sir, this is the house.

776
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:56,631
Joy.

777
00:39:10,263 --> 00:39:11,972
Are you not Akhilesh?
- Yes.

778
00:39:12,052 --> 00:39:13,630
I'm Akhilesh.
- Who are you?

779
00:39:16,086 --> 00:39:17,506
Us?
- Yes, who are you?

780
00:39:18,018 --> 00:39:19,506
Your mom's husband.

781
00:39:20,846 --> 00:39:24,009
It's a new film, so I just thought,
let her watch.

782
00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:25,259
Just walk.

783
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:27,048
I'll lose my image, sir.

784
00:39:27,173 --> 00:39:28,509
Everyone around is looking at me.

785
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:30,736
Now, everyone's going to know...
- What boorish hair?

786
00:39:32,214 --> 00:39:33,384
Well...

787
00:39:33,552 --> 00:39:35,172
When you save blue movies,

788
00:39:35,421 --> 00:39:38,089
it's enough to create a folder inside
program files in C drive, right?

789
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:39,098
Yes.

790
00:39:39,178 --> 00:39:40,339
Nobody will find out?

791
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,964
He loves porn.

792
00:39:46,748 --> 00:39:48,293
We got him after taking
a lot of twists and turns.

793
00:39:48,373 --> 00:39:49,293
Yes, we got him.

794
00:39:49,373 --> 00:39:50,915
'We got Baburaj through the dog.'

795
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,498
'Jerry through Baburaj.'

796
00:39:53,248 --> 00:39:54,707
'Anjali via. Jerry.'

797
00:39:55,415 --> 00:39:57,623
'And through Anjali, her
lover Akhilesh.'

798
00:39:58,248 --> 00:39:59,623
'Now, we can tell everyone,'

799
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,377
'that we also have a role
in solving a case,'

800
00:40:02,457 --> 00:40:04,123
'that drove Kerala mad.'

801
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,748
'To be frank,
this is a hope for us.'

802
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:09,707
'The hope that we can achieve
many more things in life.'

803
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,707
He admitted to have committed
the crime.

804
00:40:12,873 --> 00:40:15,335
We will manage the rest
of the things officially.

805
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:16,627
That is the protocol.

806
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:17,707
Move.

807
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:25,752
Sir, why didn't you take them?
Aren't they one among us?

808
00:40:25,832 --> 00:40:28,873
'We always have this fate.'

809
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,293
'We joined for engineering at Selam,'

810
00:40:31,373 --> 00:40:34,623
'as we took pride in getting
good grades in plus two.'

811
00:40:34,979 --> 00:40:36,748
'Since then, we have been trying
ways to come up in life.'

812
00:40:37,532 --> 00:40:39,643
'We managed to pass
around 46 papers,'

813
00:40:39,723 --> 00:40:41,748
'with the help of bits and
writing gas.'

814
00:40:42,168 --> 00:40:44,623
'But life isn't like that.'

815
00:40:45,707 --> 00:40:47,363
'My name's Antony George.'

816
00:40:47,443 --> 00:40:48,809
My name is Vinay Dasan.

817
00:40:48,889 --> 00:40:50,373
I'm twenty-five years old.

818
00:40:51,258 --> 00:40:52,457
I had...

819
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,585
I have... Mother.

820
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:57,415
My father's name is George.
And he is no more.

821
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:00,623
My positives are my friendly nature,

822
00:41:00,748 --> 00:41:02,373
that brings a smile on the face.

823
00:41:02,647 --> 00:41:04,540
My negative is working too hard.

824
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:07,252
I think we lost it due to
lack of fluency in English.

825
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:09,623
It would never come
out when needed.

826
00:41:09,832 --> 00:41:10,832
Give it.

827
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,623
We should have studied CBSE.

828
00:41:14,165 --> 00:41:18,085
Man, what do you say about going
for bank coaching in Kollam?

829
00:41:18,165 --> 00:41:19,252
Is it costly?

830
00:41:19,332 --> 00:41:22,290
Did you study engineering
to work in a bank?

831
00:41:22,582 --> 00:41:24,290
I am fed up of this engineering
and stuff.

832
00:41:24,498 --> 00:41:26,572
'Our neighbours and relatives,'

833
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,786
'belong to a special
category of psychos,'

834
00:41:28,942 --> 00:41:31,207
'who find fault in
everything they see.'

835
00:41:31,582 --> 00:41:33,752
'As we are not in a position to
pay back our loan money,'

836
00:41:33,832 --> 00:41:36,415
'we are forced, not to pick
some phone calls in life.'

837
00:41:36,498 --> 00:41:38,002
'I don't care about what everyone
says about me.'

838
00:41:38,082 --> 00:41:39,543
'But I'm answerable
to only one person.'

839
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:41,127
Listen to me.
- What?

840
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,335
Who are you showing
Your stubbornness to?

841
00:41:42,415 --> 00:41:43,832
I'll call you back.

842
00:41:44,748 --> 00:41:46,247
Hello...
- Listen, girl.

843
00:41:46,327 --> 00:41:49,085
To have good things in life,
you will have to ignore some...

844
00:41:49,165 --> 00:41:50,335
That's the fate of every
single girl.

845
00:41:50,415 --> 00:41:52,415
'She has been with me since
my higher secondary.'

846
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:55,998
'Though she always fights with me,
she loves me a lot.'

847
00:41:56,082 --> 00:41:57,939
'I need to find a job,'

848
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:01,123
'before meeting her dad to
ask her hand in marriage.'

849
00:42:01,203 --> 00:42:03,207
'Whenever my attempts for
a job fail, I think,'

850
00:42:03,415 --> 00:42:05,373
'God will have better plans for me.'

851
00:42:05,627 --> 00:42:06,748
'No chance.'

852
00:42:06,832 --> 00:42:09,332
'Great philosophy, low life.'

853
00:42:13,623 --> 00:42:15,165
Just pick the call, hello.

854
00:42:15,582 --> 00:42:16,748
Hey, sir is here.

855
00:42:17,123 --> 00:42:18,540
Hang up, hang up.

856
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:22,620
Want a smoke?

857
00:42:23,156 --> 00:42:25,123
No, sir... We don't smoke.

858
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,623
That's good.

859
00:42:29,248 --> 00:42:31,207
The final credit goes to the Cyber Cell.

860
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,540
But... The actual
credit goes to you.

861
00:42:35,915 --> 00:42:37,239
We don't need any credit, sir.

862
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:39,707
We did it for some money.

863
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:52,082
Aren't you happy?
- Yes, thank you, sir.

864
00:42:52,676 --> 00:42:53,498
Sir,

865
00:42:54,332 --> 00:42:56,457
Please don't mistake
us for asking this.

866
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,710
Do you want money?
- No, we don't want any money.

867
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,748
Then what?

868
00:43:01,566 --> 00:43:05,040
Do you have any job
openings there?

869
00:43:05,123 --> 00:43:06,252
Where?

870
00:43:06,457 --> 00:43:07,623
In the Cyber Cell.

871
00:43:09,082 --> 00:43:10,502
That's difficult, dear.

872
00:43:10,582 --> 00:43:13,002
You need to pass the PSC test,
and undergo police training...

873
00:43:13,082 --> 00:43:17,123
Also, the Cyber Cell recruits
candidates with computer knowledge.

874
00:43:17,248 --> 00:43:18,502
You try for PSC.

875
00:43:18,691 --> 00:43:21,373
No! PSC and all won't work out.

876
00:43:21,873 --> 00:43:23,540
Just give it a try.
- Be positive.

877
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:25,168
We are writing the tests.

878
00:43:25,415 --> 00:43:26,665
Sir, just a minute.

879
00:43:29,123 --> 00:43:30,498
To be frank,

880
00:43:30,998 --> 00:43:34,290
after plus two, we joined B-tech like
jumping onto the bandwagon.

881
00:43:35,054 --> 00:43:36,627
We are not getting a job.

882
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:37,710
So, life is being creepy.

883
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,002
Who all are there
at your house?

884
00:43:39,082 --> 00:43:41,623
At home, I have my dad, mom...

885
00:43:41,957 --> 00:43:43,210
A sister...

886
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,869
No, I had a sister; she
expired four years ago.

887
00:43:45,949 --> 00:43:48,252
'Why are you finding it
difficult to face me?'

888
00:43:48,332 --> 00:43:49,457
'I want to know.'

889
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,085
Dear, I'll come and meet you.

890
00:43:51,165 --> 00:43:52,502
We will discuss it then.

891
00:43:52,582 --> 00:43:54,710
'I adjusted my shift only because
you said you would meet me today.'

892
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,835
Dear, I told, I would come.

893
00:43:56,915 --> 00:43:58,668
Please wait for me, please.
- 'I'm still waiting.'

894
00:43:58,748 --> 00:43:59,960
'But for how long?'

895
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,582
Please don't repeat the same thing.
Didn't I tell you I would come?

896
00:44:04,832 --> 00:44:06,540
Sir, shall we leave?

897
00:44:06,832 --> 00:44:08,832
You are leaving?
- Okay, All the best.

898
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,498
Call sometimes, or else we
might forget. Isn't it, Joy?

899
00:44:11,933 --> 00:44:13,040
Bye.
- See you, sir.

900
00:44:14,248 --> 00:44:15,248
Okay.

901
00:44:15,957 --> 00:44:17,332
What is it?
- Come.

902
00:44:17,457 --> 00:44:19,290
What is the matter?
- Nothing.

903
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:21,457
They are good, aren't they?
- They rock.

904
00:44:21,748 --> 00:44:22,832
They will sail through.

905
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,707
What makes a jobless
chap like you so busy?

906
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:07,710
At least my tensions...
My problems...

907
00:45:07,869 --> 00:45:09,582
Can't you understand all those?

908
00:45:10,265 --> 00:45:12,248
Okay, tell me, what's your worry?

909
00:45:12,332 --> 00:45:14,040
You! You are my tension.

910
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:20,289
Didn't I tell you earlier?

911
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:21,873
I got a job.

912
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:23,832
The offer letter has come.

913
00:45:24,302 --> 00:45:28,337
Supernova, it's a government
hospital in Ireland.

914
00:45:29,248 --> 00:45:31,040
The salary is two lakhs per month.

915
00:45:31,442 --> 00:45:33,415
I would like to go.

916
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:35,790
What is your opinion?

917
00:45:36,402 --> 00:45:37,885
What are you supposed to do if
you have received the offer letter?

918
00:45:37,965 --> 00:45:39,582
You must go.
- So?

919
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:43,592
You go and settle down there…

920
00:45:43,873 --> 00:45:45,623
And then take me along.

921
00:45:45,998 --> 00:45:47,025
Wonderful!

922
00:45:47,105 --> 00:45:51,332
Antony, you either find a job,
and talk to my mom or...

923
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:56,210
I don't want to introduce you as a
husband who is dependent on me.

924
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,293
Be practical.

925
00:45:57,373 --> 00:45:59,082
You can go on advising me
to be practical.

926
00:45:59,162 --> 00:46:00,337
But I'm not getting a job.

927
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:03,040
But, you aren't even trying for it.
- Who told you that I'm not trying?

928
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:05,418
Antony, don't try to blindly
justify yourself.

929
00:46:05,498 --> 00:46:06,668
I'm not justifying or anything.

930
00:46:06,748 --> 00:46:09,165
Who else should I talk to
about my grief?

931
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:31,832
I'm fed up.

932
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:34,623
I'm really fed up.

933
00:46:38,668 --> 00:46:40,460
Can't you be a bit more sincere?

934
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,040
At least towards yourself?

935
00:46:46,457 --> 00:46:49,998
Are you even half sincere to me
as you are to your friends?

936
00:46:50,832 --> 00:46:52,623
Am I not tolerating you since
the twelfth grade?

937
00:46:52,707 --> 00:46:54,040
You do want to break
up with me?

938
00:46:54,707 --> 00:46:55,832
Go for it.

939
00:46:56,373 --> 00:46:58,290
No need to create a dramatic scene.

940
00:46:58,947 --> 00:47:01,043
When you heard about the
two lakhs salary from Ireland,

941
00:47:01,123 --> 00:47:02,832
I became an utter waste for you.

942
00:47:04,228 --> 00:47:06,748
You may go to Ireland, and enjoy.

943
00:48:23,623 --> 00:48:24,623
Dude.

944
00:48:25,165 --> 00:48:26,832
Are you still thinking about it?

945
00:48:27,726 --> 00:48:28,763
Leave it, dear.

946
00:48:28,902 --> 00:48:31,123
It's good she broke up now.

947
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:33,468
Whatever is over is gone!
Crap.

948
00:48:35,498 --> 00:48:36,918
She's gone to Ireland, right?

949
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,957
Ireland is not a place that
we don't know.

950
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:41,040
Do you want to go
to Ireland now?

951
00:48:52,248 --> 00:48:53,415
Ramanathan,

952
00:48:53,915 --> 00:48:56,123
the report has come from
Thiruvananthapuram.

953
00:48:57,082 --> 00:48:58,665
According to their report,

954
00:48:59,387 --> 00:49:02,290
when they processed the
video for the details,

955
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:04,165
they confirmed that,

956
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,582
it is Janaki herself in the video.

957
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,433
How could it be her?

958
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:12,582
Are you saying the ones who
prepared the report are idiots?

959
00:49:16,165 --> 00:49:17,415
It's not her, sir.

960
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:19,498
Hey…

961
00:49:19,578 --> 00:49:21,242
You might say that it's not her.

962
00:49:21,322 --> 00:49:22,668
But this is the proof.

963
00:49:22,748 --> 00:49:23,748
Do you get it?

964
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:26,377
When you were high on drugs and
alcohol, she must have enjoyed too.

965
00:49:26,457 --> 00:49:28,168
What will you do if such an ill-fate
comes upon your mom or sister?

966
00:49:28,248 --> 00:49:29,183
What did you just say?

967
00:49:29,263 --> 00:49:30,835
You moron, are you messing
with us at our fiefdom?

968
00:49:30,915 --> 00:49:32,474
Sir, do you know how much
did we suffer due to this?

969
00:49:32,554 --> 00:49:34,002
Leave me, sir.
I'll take his piss out.

970
00:49:34,082 --> 00:49:37,040
I was a drunkard during
the time she decided to live with me.

971
00:49:38,082 --> 00:49:39,957
I know everything about her.

972
00:49:40,582 --> 00:49:42,029
Can't he show some courtesy?

973
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:43,028
Who are you to teach us (cops),
courtesy?

974
00:49:43,108 --> 00:49:44,290
Please be seated, Ramanathan.

975
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,329
Sit, Ramana...

976
00:49:46,409 --> 00:49:47,867
Get lost, you…
- Hey, Bash...

977
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:50,582
Sorry, Ramanathan.
Let's talk it out.

978
00:49:53,748 --> 00:49:56,082
It's been 7-8 months since
the whole ordeal began.

979
00:49:56,278 --> 00:49:58,043
That is a video made by
deceiving a naive girl,

980
00:49:58,123 --> 00:49:59,748
at some other place.

981
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:02,873
It's my friend who
spread the news,

982
00:50:03,248 --> 00:50:05,373
that Ramanathan's wife
is on a blue movie.

983
00:50:05,748 --> 00:50:07,460
I told everyone a hundred
times that it's not her.

984
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,877
No one believed.

985
00:50:09,062 --> 00:50:10,998
Everyone is more interested
in believing, it's my wife.

986
00:50:11,832 --> 00:50:13,373
Our helplessness,

987
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,582
is what the world is celebrating
as 'Viral'... isn't it, sir?

988
00:50:15,707 --> 00:50:17,877
You will be disgusted to hear the
comments passed by everyone,

989
00:50:17,957 --> 00:50:20,498
including my daughter's male
teachers and schoolmates.

990
00:50:21,165 --> 00:50:23,207
My child stopped going to school.

991
00:50:23,748 --> 00:50:25,290
She is staying at my sister's house.

992
00:50:25,499 --> 00:50:27,290
She's scared to come
home, it seems,

993
00:50:27,373 --> 00:50:29,915
scared to live with her
own mother, hatred...

994
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:34,165
I know for sure that
it's not my wife.

995
00:50:34,415 --> 00:50:36,332
It's for my daughter,
I'm here.

996
00:50:36,873 --> 00:50:38,707
What should I do now?
Tell me, sir.

997
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,040
Do you want me to go
to Delhi or Bombay?

998
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,835
We also want to live here.

999
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:44,248
My daughter wants to live here.

1000
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,290
We also want to live here.

1001
00:52:08,457 --> 00:52:11,915
When I see her face,
my entire day cripples.

1002
00:52:12,332 --> 00:52:13,873
That's not her in the video.

1003
00:52:14,248 --> 00:52:16,998
What are these people
preparing the reports doing there?

1004
00:52:17,582 --> 00:52:18,582
Sir.

1005
00:52:20,707 --> 00:52:21,793
Hi, what's up?
- We are good.

1006
00:52:21,873 --> 00:52:23,418
No calls, nothing... since then.

1007
00:52:23,498 --> 00:52:24,793
We were a bit busy.

1008
00:52:24,873 --> 00:52:26,873
The reason why we asked
you here is...

1009
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,457
Last week, we had
a meeting with IG

1010
00:52:30,985 --> 00:52:31,998
Joy...

1011
00:52:32,279 --> 00:52:35,082
As a part of upgrading
the Cyber Cell,

1012
00:52:35,373 --> 00:52:38,418
they are planning to hire
technically qualified people,

1013
00:52:38,498 --> 00:52:40,123
as interns in Cyber Cell.

1014
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,720
It's been two weeks since we
received the government order.

1015
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,582
Who and how to hire people
is purely my discretion.

1016
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:48,207
If you like, you can join us.

1017
00:52:49,707 --> 00:52:51,210
You can assist us in
our investigation.

1018
00:52:52,165 --> 00:52:55,415
But you will not get all the
benefits the police receive.

1019
00:52:55,873 --> 00:52:57,957
It's like a temporary posting.

1020
00:52:58,082 --> 00:52:59,367
But not entirely...

1021
00:52:59,447 --> 00:53:01,498
You will get a salary of around ten
thousand.

1022
00:53:01,998 --> 00:53:05,540
But you won't become permanent
by time as other jobs.

1023
00:53:06,044 --> 00:53:07,168
That's okay.

1024
00:53:07,248 --> 00:53:08,707
So, aren't you joining?

1025
00:53:09,299 --> 00:53:10,582
Yes, sir.

1026
00:53:11,774 --> 00:53:12,707
Okay, sir.

1027
00:53:13,262 --> 00:53:15,029
Okay, Sir.
- Come on.

1028
00:53:35,353 --> 00:53:37,520
Why think so much?
Just shave it.

1029
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:39,459
Shave it, I say.

1030
00:53:40,603 --> 00:53:41,735
Shave underneath
your moustache.

1031
00:53:41,915 --> 00:53:43,273
And when you roll up
your moustache...

1032
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:44,673
Only if I start from here,
I can end it here.

1033
00:53:44,753 --> 00:53:46,690
This is not police but the Cyber Cell.

1034
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:48,978
A beard is fine.
- That's okay, you shave it off.

1035
00:53:49,058 --> 00:53:50,357
You will become clean.
- Tell me.

1036
00:53:50,437 --> 00:53:52,523
Has your son passed
his exams?

1037
00:53:52,603 --> 00:53:54,017
He has a good salary.

1038
00:53:54,245 --> 00:53:55,561
Seventy five thousand rupees.

1039
00:53:55,641 --> 00:53:58,062
'So much?'
- Mom, don't stretch it.

1040
00:53:58,246 --> 00:53:59,315
You get lost, boy.

1041
00:53:59,395 --> 00:54:03,062
They always poke me
about you being jobless.

1042
00:54:03,221 --> 00:54:04,681
Let her feel green with envy
for some time.

1043
00:54:04,761 --> 00:54:06,197
I need to call two more...

1044
00:54:09,026 --> 00:54:10,367
Did you get a job?
- Yes.

1045
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:12,131
Where is it?
- Cyber Cell.

1046
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:13,886
Is it permanent?
- No, it's a temporary job.

1047
00:54:13,966 --> 00:54:14,907
Oh, too bad.

1048
00:54:14,987 --> 00:54:16,387
Such a negative chap!

1049
00:54:28,187 --> 00:54:29,312
Hi, aunt!

1050
00:54:29,623 --> 00:54:30,853
All good?

1051
00:54:40,937 --> 00:54:42,270
All the best.

1052
00:54:42,353 --> 00:54:43,174
Thank you, sir.

1053
00:54:43,254 --> 00:54:45,478
Just meet Joy, sir.
Aren't you happy?

1054
00:54:46,979 --> 00:54:49,661
Tuck in shirt and all, huh?
- It's just here.

1055
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,982
What uniform do you
have at the Cyber Cell?

1056
00:54:52,062 --> 00:54:53,232
Just this.

1057
00:54:53,312 --> 00:54:55,528
We are supposed to wear
a uniform on Mondays.

1058
00:54:55,608 --> 00:54:56,565
But no one wears.

1059
00:54:56,645 --> 00:54:58,940
Why I asked is I have set
of khaki pants for me.

1060
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,065
Since this is our first day...

1061
00:55:00,145 --> 00:55:02,027
He is Sanjay.
- Yeah, we know.

1062
00:55:02,107 --> 00:55:03,270
Hi, sir.

1063
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,045
This is our team.
- Hi.

1064
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:06,075
Hi.

1065
00:55:06,325 --> 00:55:07,690
Basheer.
- Yes.

1066
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:08,980
Our guys are joining today.

1067
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,228
Hi, sir.

1068
00:55:11,055 --> 00:55:13,243
You may sit here.
You can keep this chair there.

1069
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,054
This is your place.
- Thank you, sir.

1070
00:55:18,478 --> 00:55:20,190
Well, you probably
know them, right?

1071
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:21,815
Yes, we talked last time.

1072
00:55:21,895 --> 00:55:23,148
She is Anita.
- Thank you, sir.

1073
00:55:23,228 --> 00:55:24,982
Das... Antony...
- Thank you, sir.

1074
00:55:25,062 --> 00:55:26,995
Sir, here are the details
of the admin.

1075
00:55:27,075 --> 00:55:28,773
Dasan.
- All the best.

1076
00:55:28,853 --> 00:55:30,232
All the best.
- Thank you, sir.

1077
00:55:30,312 --> 00:55:31,648
All the best.
- Thank you.

1078
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:34,103
Hello, they just joined.
Just a minute.

1079
00:55:34,454 --> 00:55:36,350
So, all the best. Rock it.
- Thank you.

1080
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,398
Basheer.

1081
00:55:37,648 --> 00:55:40,020
Just brief them...
About everything.

1082
00:55:40,908 --> 00:55:42,353
Yes, they are joining today.

1083
00:55:42,603 --> 00:55:44,853
I was arranging chairs for them.
- Happy, huh?

1084
00:55:46,952 --> 00:55:49,187
You are the first engineers
to make it to the Cyber Cell.

1085
00:55:50,368 --> 00:55:53,937
Passing B-tech is possible
only for people with brains.

1086
00:55:54,645 --> 00:55:56,482
But my boy passed
all the papers.

1087
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:57,982
There are around forty six
papers in total.

1088
00:55:58,062 --> 00:55:59,232
He studied everything.

1089
00:55:59,312 --> 00:56:00,940
He is good at studies, isn't he?
- Yes, of course.

1090
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,148
He is very talented.

1091
00:56:02,228 --> 00:56:03,523
He got a job too.

1092
00:56:03,603 --> 00:56:05,315
Where is he working?
- In the police...

1093
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:06,482
Really?

1094
00:56:06,562 --> 00:56:08,107
He's in the Cyber Cell.

1095
00:56:08,187 --> 00:56:10,148
Name?
- Parveen, sir.

1096
00:56:10,228 --> 00:56:11,607
Parveen.
- Parveen.

1097
00:56:11,687 --> 00:56:14,273
Here... Where... Just ask him
where in Kerala is he staying?

1098
00:56:14,353 --> 00:56:16,565
Where in Kerala are you staying?
- Perumbaavoor, sir.

1099
00:56:16,645 --> 00:56:17,937
Where are you from?

1100
00:56:18,353 --> 00:56:19,315
Assam.

1101
00:56:19,395 --> 00:56:20,770
What's ... Er...

1102
00:56:20,853 --> 00:56:21,853
What...

1103
00:56:22,353 --> 00:56:23,379
Paisa...

1104
00:56:23,459 --> 00:56:25,023
What?
- What's your problem?

1105
00:56:25,103 --> 00:56:27,398
My six thousand rupees has been stolen.
Six thousand rupees!

1106
00:56:27,558 --> 00:56:29,065
He lost six thousand rupees, it seems.

1107
00:56:29,145 --> 00:56:30,812
Huh! I will definitely call...

1108
00:56:34,186 --> 00:56:36,187
Just a minute.
Please come here.

1109
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,940
Who are you in here?

1110
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,898
I.	I'm a staff in here.

1111
00:56:39,978 --> 00:56:42,062
You should solve my issue.

1112
00:56:42,835 --> 00:56:45,270
What's your problem, sir?
- Is this a cucumber town?

1113
00:56:45,562 --> 00:56:48,020
It's 60,000 rupees I lost
in the past 8 hours.

1114
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,773
You must return
my money back.

1115
00:56:50,853 --> 00:56:51,916
Otherwise, you...

1116
00:56:51,996 --> 00:56:53,523
Just a minute.
- Are you going?

1117
00:56:53,603 --> 00:56:54,607
Joy sir,

1118
00:56:54,687 --> 00:56:57,062
Stop there, stop.
Let me talk.

1119
00:56:58,312 --> 00:56:59,520
What's your problem, sir?

1120
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:01,815
Who are you?
- I'm the ASI here.

1121
00:57:01,895 --> 00:57:03,857
ASI's board is there, and
why don't you sit there?

1122
00:57:03,937 --> 00:57:05,895
Instead, why are you
hanging around here?

1123
00:57:06,187 --> 00:57:07,520
What's your problem, sir?

1124
00:57:08,478 --> 00:57:10,065
Sit. Sit. Please sit.

1125
00:57:10,145 --> 00:57:12,065
Why is this place like
a hen's pen?

1126
00:57:12,145 --> 00:57:13,437
Is this the Cyber Cell?

1127
00:57:13,812 --> 00:57:16,103
Yes, this itself is the Cyber Cell.
What's the case, sir?

1128
00:57:16,623 --> 00:57:20,020
When I was
driving my car,

1129
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:23,312
a lady called on my phone.

1130
00:57:23,629 --> 00:57:27,227
She said the validity of my
card has expired,

1131
00:57:27,307 --> 00:57:31,398
and asked me to send the OTP
number to renew the card.

1132
00:57:31,478 --> 00:57:33,270
I sent her the OTP number

1133
00:57:33,645 --> 00:57:35,853
I lost thirty thousand rupees on the spot.

1134
00:57:36,437 --> 00:57:39,270
The next morning, another
thirty thousand were gone.

1135
00:57:39,437 --> 00:57:40,648
Sir, you need to be careful.

1136
00:57:40,728 --> 00:57:42,482
You shouldn't share the OTP
number with anyone.

1137
00:57:42,562 --> 00:57:45,145
I was cautious while
sending it to them.

1138
00:57:45,353 --> 00:57:47,645
It's my OTP number
I sent them.

1139
00:57:48,103 --> 00:57:49,732
I must get my money back.
- Antony...

1140
00:57:49,812 --> 00:57:51,065
Yes, you will get it, sir.

1141
00:57:51,145 --> 00:57:53,270
Aneesh, get the details from him.
- Okay, sir.

1142
00:57:53,478 --> 00:57:56,940
See from which number
he got the call... And trace it.

1143
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,315
Sir, what's your name?
Your name?

1144
00:57:59,395 --> 00:58:01,103
My name is Balachandran.

1145
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:02,367
Please write it down.

1146
00:58:02,447 --> 00:58:03,681
Where are you working, sir?

1147
00:58:03,761 --> 00:58:06,145
I'm the manager of SBY bank,
Kadavanthara.

1148
00:58:07,645 --> 00:58:08,637
What did you just say?

1149
00:58:08,717 --> 00:58:11,687
I'm the manager of SBY bank,
Kadavanthara.

1150
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:13,937
Aneesh, please deal with it yourself.

1151
00:58:15,297 --> 00:58:17,312
I'm the manager. So, I should
get my money back.

1152
00:58:17,937 --> 00:58:18,898
You will get it, sir.

1153
00:58:18,978 --> 00:58:20,853
I will call you back.

1154
00:58:24,937 --> 00:58:27,603
Wow! Yummy!
The curry is yummy.

1155
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:28,895
Super.

1156
00:58:29,062 --> 00:58:31,312
You started looking cool after
shaving your beard.

1157
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:34,228
Mummy, even I have
shaved my beard.

1158
00:58:34,437 --> 00:58:35,895
Did you even have a beard?

1159
00:58:37,728 --> 00:58:39,723
Your dosa is not as tasty as before.

1160
00:59:13,562 --> 00:59:14,523
Sir,

1161
00:59:14,603 --> 00:59:16,437
I was in love with a girl.

1162
00:59:17,187 --> 00:59:20,312
I had sent her a few
photos and videos.

1163
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:24,023
Now, she is using those photos
and videos,

1164
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:25,167
to blackmail me.

1165
00:59:25,247 --> 00:59:27,273
Has she sent her photos to you?

1166
00:59:27,353 --> 00:59:29,148
No, she hasn't.
- No?

1167
00:59:29,228 --> 00:59:30,687
Where is she right now?

1168
00:59:31,014 --> 00:59:33,523
The girl is in Philippines.

1169
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:34,853
Philippines, huh?

1170
00:59:35,312 --> 00:59:37,020
Why is she asking
money from you?

1171
00:59:37,391 --> 00:59:39,187
She's asking money because,

1172
00:59:39,353 --> 00:59:41,023
the photos I sent were
a bit cheesy.

1173
00:59:41,103 --> 00:59:42,315
What kind of photos?

1174
00:59:42,395 --> 00:59:44,398
The other kind of photos...

1175
00:59:44,478 --> 00:59:45,690
You mean, nude?

1176
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:47,187
Yes, kind of...

1177
00:59:47,352 --> 00:59:48,407
To a Philippine girl?

1178
00:59:48,487 --> 00:59:51,493
Sir, it was by a mistake.
- Have you seen those photos?

1179
00:59:51,677 --> 00:59:53,633
No, I haven't seen them.
- Haven't you shown him those?

1180
00:59:53,713 --> 00:59:56,062
Why? Isn't he, your friend?
Why didn't you show it to him?

1181
00:59:56,142 --> 00:59:58,687
How can I show those
kind of photos to him?

1182
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:00,603
Were you drunk then?

1183
01:00:00,899 --> 01:00:02,315
Yes, I was a little drunk.

1184
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:05,770
Basheer sir, this is your case.

1185
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:07,331
This is a case, he
shows interest in.

1186
01:00:07,411 --> 01:00:09,690
Oh, is she from Philippines?

1187
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:11,273
How did you fall in love with her?

1188
01:00:11,353 --> 01:00:14,232
I sent her a request hoping
to learn English.

1189
01:00:14,312 --> 01:00:15,273
You know what,

1190
01:00:15,353 --> 01:00:17,881
even Philippinos don't know
English properly.

1191
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:20,023
If you have such a wish,

1192
01:00:20,103 --> 01:00:21,704
you should be sending requests
to English girls in the US or UK.

1193
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,690
Can you help, sir?

1194
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:25,773
What is she saying now?

1195
01:00:25,853 --> 01:00:28,440
She is demanding one lakh.
- No, it is one and a half.

1196
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,898
Is it one or one and half?
- Sir, it is one.

1197
01:00:30,978 --> 01:00:32,815
Are you going to pay
her the money?

1198
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,690
Sir, I don't have any
money with me.

1199
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:36,732
Okay, then tell me, what
shall we do now?

1200
01:00:36,812 --> 01:00:38,482
Sir, he's getting married
next week.

1201
01:00:38,562 --> 01:00:39,690
Marriage!

1202
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:41,940
He's getting married, please
do something about it.

1203
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:43,815
What's your name?
- Shibukuttan.

1204
01:00:43,895 --> 01:00:47,103
Well Shibukuttan, what we
can do about this is,

1205
01:00:47,187 --> 01:00:50,940
If at all she leaks your
photos or details,

1206
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:55,357
on Instagram, Facebook or You-tube,

1207
01:00:55,437 --> 01:00:57,065
We can remove it from there.

1208
01:00:57,145 --> 01:00:58,023
Jeez!

1209
01:00:58,103 --> 01:01:01,273
There's no provision to stop
her from posting them.

1210
01:01:01,353 --> 01:01:02,815
Because, she's in Philippines.

1211
01:01:02,895 --> 01:01:05,103
Moreover, we don't have the capacity
to go there and interrogate her.

1212
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:09,773
Sir, won't you help?
- Sure.

1213
01:01:09,853 --> 01:01:12,020
It's my marriage.
- Don't worry, we will solve it.

1214
01:01:18,395 --> 01:01:19,565
Mr Antony.

1215
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:21,103
What's up?

1216
01:01:21,687 --> 01:01:23,940
Did you get any details
about that Ashwathi Achu?

1217
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,645
It's hopeless, man.

1218
01:01:25,853 --> 01:01:27,982
Nothing yet? What's it showing?
- It's invalid.

1219
01:01:28,062 --> 01:01:30,187
Invalid?
- Yes, it's all fake.

1220
01:01:31,211 --> 01:01:32,812
Let me see for mutual friends.

1221
01:01:33,353 --> 01:01:35,648
Dude, just open the Facebook.
- That's mine.

1222
01:01:35,728 --> 01:01:37,023
Just show me.
Just a minute.

1223
01:01:37,103 --> 01:01:38,246
Why do you want to look
at my Facebook?

1224
01:01:38,326 --> 01:01:40,565
I'll give it back just now. - Don't
device any stratagem with it.

1225
01:01:40,645 --> 01:01:42,128
Unlike before, it's the Cyber Cell.

1226
01:01:42,267 --> 01:01:43,190
Go, man.

1227
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:44,473
We will feel embarrassed.

1228
01:01:48,992 --> 01:01:50,312
So, this is the matter.

1229
01:01:50,437 --> 01:01:51,648
Didn't you leave her?

1230
01:01:51,728 --> 01:01:52,857
How many times did
I warn you?

1231
01:01:52,937 --> 01:01:54,188
Aren't you done getting
dumped by that girl once?

1232
01:01:55,187 --> 01:01:56,544
Do you know,
only those who were blocked,

1233
01:01:56,624 --> 01:01:58,077
by someone have succeeded in life.

1234
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,773
Fresh proverb, huh?
Did you make it now?

1235
01:02:01,853 --> 01:02:03,937
Yes, it came from my heart.

1236
01:02:05,243 --> 01:02:06,440
Give it to me.

1237
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,750
You will understand it only once some
one ditches you for the second time.

1238
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,603
Pass me the cigarette.
- Don't finish it, okay?

1239
01:02:22,603 --> 01:02:24,812
Hey, buddy, the salary has
been credited.

1240
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,145
Why are you early today?

1241
01:02:49,228 --> 01:02:50,353
Nothing.

1242
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:55,145
What's this?

1243
01:02:56,103 --> 01:02:57,978
I bought it from my first salary.

1244
01:03:01,187 --> 01:03:02,437
Saree, huh?

1245
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,607
If you don't like it, you
can get it exchanged.

1246
01:03:04,687 --> 01:03:06,145
It's a nice saree.

1247
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:07,273
Dear sir,

1248
01:03:07,353 --> 01:03:10,336
I ordered an I-phone for
five thousand using a link on WhatsApp.

1249
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:11,919
I-phone for just five thousand rupees?
- Yes.

1250
01:03:11,999 --> 01:03:13,363
Show me the phone.

1251
01:03:13,443 --> 01:03:14,590
It's a tile.

1252
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:16,065
Wow! What a phone, man?

1253
01:03:16,145 --> 01:03:17,523
Sir, are you kidding me?

1254
01:03:17,603 --> 01:03:20,728
I raised the money, borrowing
and doing catering work.

1255
01:03:21,638 --> 01:03:23,982
Sir, will you get my money back
instead of taking photos?

1256
01:03:24,062 --> 01:03:25,648
Let's inquire about this.

1257
01:03:25,728 --> 01:03:27,857
We came to collect the details.
We will see to it.

1258
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:30,523
It's enough I get my money back.
I leave the phone.

1259
01:03:30,603 --> 01:03:31,561
It seems like we forced him...

1260
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,065
Aren't you sure if
I would get my money?

1261
01:03:33,145 --> 01:03:34,982
Didn't you hear, we are
here to collect the details.

1262
01:03:35,062 --> 01:03:36,049
What course are you doing?
- B-tech.

1263
01:03:36,129 --> 01:03:38,148
B-tech, believing to get an
I-phone for just five thousand rupees.

1264
01:03:38,228 --> 01:03:40,107
Keep it with you.
- Same pinch, okay?

1265
01:03:40,187 --> 01:03:41,607
Fix the tile using cement, okay?

1266
01:03:41,687 --> 01:03:43,103
I'm super pranked.

1267
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:45,857
Ma'am, you cops are so
irresponsible.

1268
01:03:45,937 --> 01:03:48,363
I'm not able to chill out
peacefully.

1269
01:03:48,443 --> 01:03:50,736
Man, what a dark scene is this!

1270
01:03:50,816 --> 01:03:52,312
Hey, just remove your
cooling glass.

1271
01:03:53,687 --> 01:03:55,190
Is the dark scene over now?
- Yes.

1272
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:57,065
Do you have your mobile with you?
- Yes.

1273
01:03:57,145 --> 01:03:58,173
Give it to her.

1274
01:03:58,253 --> 01:03:59,619
What is it, Basheer?
- Give it to her.

1275
01:04:00,394 --> 01:04:02,728
Sir, read this and see.

1276
01:04:04,116 --> 01:04:07,357
Sir, we had gone for a
trip to Goa last week.

1277
01:04:07,527 --> 01:04:09,107
When we were back home,

1278
01:04:09,187 --> 01:04:11,853
none of our costly
stuff were there.

1279
01:04:12,353 --> 01:04:13,565
Bog off, kiddo.

1280
01:04:13,645 --> 01:04:15,565
Madam, it's not here that
You complain about a case like this.

1281
01:04:15,645 --> 01:04:17,255
Instead, you must lodge
a complaint with the police.

1282
01:04:17,335 --> 01:04:19,270
It has no connection with us.

1283
01:04:19,353 --> 01:04:21,353
No sir, there's a small
connection with us.

1284
01:04:21,687 --> 01:04:23,107
When they started their tour,

1285
01:04:23,187 --> 01:04:25,395
this halfwit put a post
on Facebook.

1286
01:04:26,587 --> 01:04:28,057
See it.
- Sir, it's nothing.

1287
01:04:28,137 --> 01:04:31,232
I just wrote, five day trip to
Goa, rocking with mom.'

1288
01:04:31,312 --> 01:04:33,148
Isn't it, mom?
- Don't get beaten up by me.

1289
01:04:33,228 --> 01:04:34,648
Below the post,

1290
01:04:34,728 --> 01:04:37,023
there's a comment with
a photo of Kylo Ren.

1291
01:04:37,103 --> 01:04:39,474
'' Sweets, you rock it there,
and we will rock it here.''

1292
01:04:39,554 --> 01:04:42,228
Dear, sir, first of all,
He is not my friend.

1293
01:04:42,308 --> 01:04:45,036
They are thieves for sure.

1294
01:04:45,116 --> 01:04:47,398
Ma'am, you may register
a complaint with the police.

1295
01:04:47,478 --> 01:04:48,648
It's them who must
see to the case.

1296
01:04:48,728 --> 01:04:51,273
Only if they pass anything
to us, we take action on it.

1297
01:04:51,353 --> 01:04:53,634
Won't we get our things back, sir?
- You will. Better approach the police.

1298
01:04:53,714 --> 01:04:54,906
Boy, you come here.

1299
01:04:54,986 --> 01:04:57,187
My phone...
- You will get it, come with me now.

1300
01:04:57,457 --> 01:04:58,690
What is your name?

1301
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,482
My name is Sanju Techie.
- Is Techie your initial?

1302
01:05:00,562 --> 01:05:02,460
No, sir, I put it for style.

1303
01:05:03,145 --> 01:05:05,607
Techie's mom, you have
only one like this at your house?

1304
01:05:05,687 --> 01:05:07,607
I have one more like him.
He's gone for a trip,

1305
01:05:07,687 --> 01:05:08,589
to Manali.

1306
01:05:09,067 --> 01:05:11,770
Kiddo, you must not share
such posts on Facebook.

1307
01:05:12,312 --> 01:05:15,440
Like... Time, or the number of
days you're going, etc...

1308
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,940
Don't share it publicly.

1309
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:19,395
You can share it with your friends
if they must know.

1310
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,482
Do you get it?

1311
01:05:20,562 --> 01:05:22,232
You shouldn't do such
things from now.

1312
01:05:22,312 --> 01:05:24,645
Why are you making it
dark every time, huh?

1313
01:05:25,687 --> 01:05:27,398
Sir, please speed up things.

1314
01:05:27,478 --> 01:05:28,315
Mom, all is set.

1315
01:05:28,395 --> 01:05:31,440
After the police forward it to us,
we will take care of the rest.

1316
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,023
Everything's okay.
- Thank you, sir.

1317
01:05:33,103 --> 01:05:35,255
Come, let's go.
- Mom, just pass me the phone.

1318
01:05:35,428 --> 01:05:38,107
Why? - I want to post a selfie
saying, 'Feeling frustrated'.

1319
01:05:38,187 --> 01:05:39,857
Selfie. Aren't you done with this?

1320
01:05:39,937 --> 01:05:41,378
You better take a selfie
with your mom's corpse.

1321
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:43,703
What's wrong with taking a photo?
- Just walk.

1322
01:06:45,244 --> 01:06:46,244
Oh, I see...

1323
01:06:46,494 --> 01:06:49,078
When did they contact you
for the first time?

1324
01:06:50,578 --> 01:06:51,953
Isn't the question clear?

1325
01:06:52,036 --> 01:06:54,869
Since when did they start
calling you?

1326
01:06:55,078 --> 01:06:56,460
That's the question. Answer me.

1327
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:58,179
Don't worry. Tell us.

1328
01:06:58,259 --> 01:07:01,119
Four days after receiving the mail,

1329
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:04,286
a Tamil lady called me.

1330
01:07:04,962 --> 01:07:08,828
She told, she is a nurse working
in an hospital in Ireland.

1331
01:07:09,164 --> 01:07:10,369
Then...

1332
01:07:10,994 --> 01:07:12,831
She confirmed that I have been
appointed to a hospital,

1333
01:07:12,911 --> 01:07:15,203
under Ireland government
with immediate effect.

1334
01:07:16,204 --> 01:07:18,456
Also, I'll get a
salary of two lakhs...

1335
01:07:18,536 --> 01:07:20,414
So? - How much did
you pay them initially?

1336
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:22,123
Ma'am, as form fee,

1337
01:07:22,203 --> 01:07:24,661
they asked me to pay
fifteen hundred to an account.

1338
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:26,703
Do you have the account
details with you?

1339
01:07:26,783 --> 01:07:28,494
Account details...

1340
01:07:30,518 --> 01:07:33,244
Sir, here are the details.

1341
01:07:36,328 --> 01:07:37,578
Antony.
- Sir.

1342
01:07:39,867 --> 01:07:41,581
Just see if you can track
the account number,

1343
01:07:41,661 --> 01:07:43,289
and the mobile number.

1344
01:07:43,369 --> 01:07:44,661
Go.
- Okay, sir.

1345
01:07:44,786 --> 01:07:46,953
Did you give any amount thereafter?

1346
01:07:47,661 --> 01:07:48,539
Hello.

1347
01:07:48,619 --> 01:07:49,786
Alphonsa...

1348
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:52,119
Hey, girl.

1349
01:07:52,286 --> 01:07:54,164
I'm asking, how much
did you give in total?

1350
01:07:54,244 --> 01:07:55,244
Well...

1351
01:07:55,641 --> 01:07:58,831
Sir, we have given them
two lakh seventy-five thousand rupees.

1352
01:07:58,911 --> 01:08:02,161
Geez! Giving this much money
to a stranger...?

1353
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:04,119
In what age are you
people living, brother?

1354
01:08:04,203 --> 01:08:05,789
My dear girl, don't you
have any friends,

1355
01:08:05,869 --> 01:08:08,289
who you can ask for a second
opinion on things like this?

1356
01:08:08,369 --> 01:08:10,780
I don't know.
- Tell you one thing,

1357
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:13,498
don't go after her again,
even if she tries to woo you.

1358
01:08:13,578 --> 01:08:15,373
I'm saying this because,
I know you very well.

1359
01:08:15,453 --> 01:08:17,203
Is anything getting on to your head?
- Yes, it is.

1360
01:08:17,369 --> 01:08:18,664
And something serious...

1361
01:08:18,744 --> 01:08:20,748
Unlike before, you have
a job now.

1362
01:08:20,828 --> 01:08:22,164
So, behave accordingly.

1363
01:08:22,244 --> 01:08:24,581
Don't even mind her by any
chance, heard it?

1364
01:08:24,661 --> 01:08:26,536
Excuse me.
- Yes.

1365
01:08:29,828 --> 01:08:32,078
Those who advised me
earlier just pulled out.

1366
01:08:32,369 --> 01:08:34,409
Please help me.

1367
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:36,998
I guess you were a person
who took sensible decisions?

1368
01:08:37,078 --> 01:08:38,286
My bad.

1369
01:08:39,244 --> 01:08:40,869
I trusted them a lot.

1370
01:08:41,536 --> 01:08:43,286
That's how they convinced me.

1371
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:46,619
They were okay with my IELTS score
and my experience here.

1372
01:08:47,244 --> 01:08:48,659
Firstly, they called for
an interview,

1373
01:08:48,739 --> 01:08:50,369
with the hospital recruitment board.

1374
01:08:51,078 --> 01:08:53,828
Later, they cancelled it
and rescheduled it on Skype.

1375
01:08:54,328 --> 01:08:55,539
So, through Skype,

1376
01:08:55,619 --> 01:08:58,244
I had a short chat with a person
abroad for four to five minutes.

1377
01:08:59,453 --> 01:09:02,956
Later, in the name of medical test,
exam fee etc.,

1378
01:09:03,036 --> 01:09:05,744
they had me pay seventy thousand rupees.

1379
01:09:06,203 --> 01:09:08,328
I even got an offer letter
after four days.

1380
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:11,039
Then came... Visa charges...

1381
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:12,869
Ireland intelligence clearance...

1382
01:09:13,994 --> 01:09:16,869
I gave them
two lakhs for all this.

1383
01:09:17,161 --> 01:09:20,081
But, they asked me
for only half the amount,

1384
01:09:20,161 --> 01:09:22,619
a nurse would normally
pay for going abroad.

1385
01:09:23,703 --> 01:09:25,619
That's the part that
attracted me.

1386
01:09:25,869 --> 01:09:27,748
I don't know what to do next.

1387
01:09:27,828 --> 01:09:29,748
I was devastated on seeing
my daughter,

1388
01:09:29,828 --> 01:09:31,956
sweat blood for a poor salary
in a private hospital.

1389
01:09:32,036 --> 01:09:33,744
That's why I...

1390
01:09:34,619 --> 01:09:37,078
We don't have anything
other than this.

1391
01:09:37,203 --> 01:09:38,498
Haven't you left yet?

1392
01:09:38,578 --> 01:09:39,498
What is it?

1393
01:09:39,578 --> 01:09:42,876
I was explaining the problem
to sir.

1394
01:09:43,334 --> 01:09:44,787
Sir? You mean, him?

1395
01:09:45,244 --> 01:09:46,828
He is just an apprentice, trainee.

1396
01:09:48,536 --> 01:09:50,703
Ah, you do one thing,
you leave now.

1397
01:09:50,828 --> 01:09:52,703
We will see to it, and
call you back.

1398
01:09:53,036 --> 01:09:54,786
Girl, you cheer up and go now.

1399
01:09:59,786 --> 01:10:01,539
Such greedy fellows!

1400
01:10:01,619 --> 01:10:03,328
How foolish are they!

1401
01:10:03,744 --> 01:10:05,289
Sir, this job a luxury?

1402
01:10:05,369 --> 01:10:06,248
Isn't it?

1403
01:10:06,328 --> 01:10:08,789
Can't they live moderately with
whatever job they have here?

1404
01:10:08,869 --> 01:10:11,744
Is Ireland or Canada the only
option to make money?

1405
01:10:11,911 --> 01:10:13,248
But, don't they need salary?

1406
01:10:13,328 --> 01:10:16,786
Son, the salary is not
just two or three lakhs...

1407
01:10:16,953 --> 01:10:19,289
But five or ten thousand is
also a salary.

1408
01:10:19,369 --> 01:10:20,536
Do you understand?

1409
01:10:20,994 --> 01:10:22,203
Greedy chaps!

1410
01:10:22,578 --> 01:10:23,536
Hello.

1411
01:10:24,161 --> 01:10:25,619
You go get me a tea.

1412
01:10:25,905 --> 01:10:28,744
Guys, Prathapan sir, is asking
for you both, go.

1413
01:10:30,369 --> 01:10:32,369
Hey, is the girl your friend?

1414
01:10:34,536 --> 01:10:35,373
What, sir?

1415
01:10:35,453 --> 01:10:37,536
I mean, the nurse...is
she, your friend?

1416
01:10:37,977 --> 01:10:40,581
She was my junior in twelfth grade.

1417
01:10:40,661 --> 01:10:43,498
Dear Prathapan sir, her complaint
regarding the job fraud case, correct?

1418
01:10:43,578 --> 01:10:45,619
She ditched him when
she got that job.

1419
01:10:45,786 --> 01:10:47,953
To be frank, it was
a great ditch.

1420
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:50,581
No sir, she didn't ditch
me or anything.

1421
01:10:50,661 --> 01:10:52,244
That's because of her situation.

1422
01:10:53,703 --> 01:10:56,703
Son, that phenomenon
is still known as 'ditching'.

1423
01:11:09,369 --> 01:11:10,369
Do one thing.

1424
01:11:10,578 --> 01:11:12,119
You investigate that case.

1425
01:11:13,328 --> 01:11:14,206
Sir...

1426
01:11:14,286 --> 01:11:16,789
How I wish that my ex-lovers
who ditched me in life,

1427
01:11:16,869 --> 01:11:18,623
come and stand in front
of me like this!

1428
01:11:18,703 --> 01:11:19,706
But it never happened.

1429
01:11:19,786 --> 01:11:21,623
This is an opportunity.
You lead this case.

1430
01:11:21,703 --> 01:11:22,789
Isn't it the 'heroism'?

1431
01:11:22,869 --> 01:11:23,869
Do it, man.

1432
01:11:24,036 --> 01:11:26,164
Isn't it, your first independent
case investigation?

1433
01:11:26,244 --> 01:11:28,203
Take it up with courage.
We are here to support you.

1434
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:33,456
'More than sixty per cent private
hospitals in Kerala,'

1435
01:11:33,536 --> 01:11:35,956
'are deceiving nurses without
giving them,'

1436
01:11:36,036 --> 01:11:39,039
'the minimum wage of 12,000
as against government order.'

1437
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:40,289
'Due to low salaries,'

1438
01:11:40,369 --> 01:11:43,744
'many are struggling to pay
back their educational loans.'

1439
01:11:44,661 --> 01:11:46,911
Man, see if there's
any case based in Kochi.

1440
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:24,373
Sir, it's a lady called Nirmala from
Chennai, who called me first.

1441
01:12:24,453 --> 01:12:26,623
She said, she wanted to conduct
a nursing recruitment drive,

1442
01:12:26,703 --> 01:12:29,081
to a hospital in the Netherlands.

1443
01:12:29,161 --> 01:12:31,664
They have come to Kochi
for about 3-4 times.

1444
01:12:32,137 --> 01:12:33,789
Her husband was one...

1445
01:12:34,317 --> 01:12:36,286
Collin Peter is a
Dutch citizen.

1446
01:12:36,366 --> 01:12:38,123
I was convinced when she said,

1447
01:12:38,203 --> 01:12:40,244
her husband would help out
with things in Netherland.

1448
01:12:40,406 --> 01:12:43,123
Do you have the photos of the
foreigner and the Tamil lady?

1449
01:12:43,203 --> 01:12:44,619
Yes, sir.
- Let me see.

1450
01:12:45,078 --> 01:12:46,786
Sir, these are the guys.

1451
01:12:46,994 --> 01:12:48,953
They are the ones
who f***ed my life.

1452
01:12:53,472 --> 01:12:55,126
No, he is not the one.

1453
01:12:56,601 --> 01:12:58,504
He has long hair.

1454
01:12:58,584 --> 01:13:00,150
He is fat too.

1455
01:13:00,413 --> 01:13:02,047
I want to see the mail
you received.

1456
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:06,384
The mails they received
are from an e-mail ID whose domain,

1457
01:13:06,464 --> 01:13:09,664
is similar to that of Supernova
hospital, i.e. hr@supernova.

1458
01:13:09,744 --> 01:13:13,039
It takes three to four thousand
rupees to create such a domain.

1459
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:14,581
Sir, we know it ourselves,

1460
01:13:14,661 --> 01:13:17,119
we get a lot of such mails
on our Gmail.

1461
01:13:17,411 --> 01:13:19,748
We need to know if any similar mode
of operations has taken place,

1462
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:22,161
in any of the cities in Kerala.

1463
01:13:22,911 --> 01:13:24,328
Chances are very high.

1464
01:13:26,828 --> 01:13:29,869
'My name is Krishnaveni,
from Nagarcoil.'

1465
01:13:30,453 --> 01:13:32,414
'I don't know what I must
do right now,'

1466
01:13:32,494 --> 01:13:34,369
'that is why I'm making this video.'

1467
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:37,369
'I think someone cheated me.'

1468
01:13:37,536 --> 01:13:39,953
Do you see any similarity
between Alphonsa issue and this?

1469
01:13:41,192 --> 01:13:43,456
There are a lot of
similarities between

1470
01:13:43,536 --> 01:13:45,456
the calls received by both
Alphonsa and Krishnaveni.

1471
01:13:45,536 --> 01:13:47,748
'They took two lakhs from me.'
- We got the details from her.

1472
01:13:47,828 --> 01:13:50,498
First, a call from a Tamil lady,
then a foreigner.

1473
01:13:50,578 --> 01:13:53,748
Their mode of operation, mailer,
server... Everything is similar.

1474
01:13:53,828 --> 01:13:56,998
Normally, online fraudsters
follow this pattern of,

1475
01:13:57,078 --> 01:14:01,036
stealing a few thousands.

1476
01:14:01,286 --> 01:14:03,039
But now, they have lost lakhs...

1477
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:05,039
This has happened
for the first time.

1478
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:08,206
Sir, as soon as the money comes
in to the fraudster's account,

1479
01:14:08,286 --> 01:14:11,789
they transfer it to various
accounts in Qatar and Oman.

1480
01:14:11,869 --> 01:14:14,748
All the account holders are based
in Tamilnadu and Karnataka.

1481
01:14:14,828 --> 01:14:16,748
But we are unable to track them.

1482
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:18,461
Sir, I got this from
Google last day.

1483
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:19,956
In a place called Jamtara,

1484
01:14:20,036 --> 01:14:22,269
a bunch of people had indulged
in an online fraud case.

1485
01:14:22,349 --> 01:14:24,789
They collect the resumes and
bio data of people,

1486
01:14:24,869 --> 01:14:26,706
from job websites like
Naukri and Indeed.

1487
01:14:26,786 --> 01:14:30,104
Then, they call the candidates,
offer them engineering jobs,

1488
01:14:30,184 --> 01:14:33,414
collect fifteen hundred rupees from each,
and then, no response...

1489
01:14:33,494 --> 01:14:36,936
Senior officials investigated
the Jamtara case.

1490
01:14:37,016 --> 01:14:40,498
They even found out, who
did it, and from where...

1491
01:14:40,578 --> 01:14:42,998
But no one could ever go
there, and arrest them.

1492
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:47,328
Well, sir, I don't think this case
is related to the Jamtara case.

1493
01:14:47,703 --> 01:14:48,956
If at all they were related,

1494
01:14:49,036 --> 01:14:51,119
the language they used in
the call would have been,

1495
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:54,536
either Hindi or Gujarati,
or local English.

1496
01:14:55,262 --> 01:14:57,203
But in this case, it is Tamil.

1497
01:14:57,424 --> 01:14:59,440
Since all these accounts are
based in Tamilnadu,

1498
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,289
this is a South Indian
racket, sir.

1499
01:15:01,369 --> 01:15:02,735
There are going to be more victims.

1500
01:15:02,815 --> 01:15:04,274
That's sure, sir.

1501
01:15:04,354 --> 01:15:07,050
Many of them wouldn't have realized
that they were cheated.

1502
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:09,420
Others wouldn't say it openly
due to embarrassment.

1503
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,461
There're going to be more
names in the coming days.

1504
01:15:11,626 --> 01:15:13,078
A common link!

1505
01:15:13,338 --> 01:15:14,731
That's what is missing here.

1506
01:15:20,494 --> 01:15:21,744
Dasan.
- Yes.

1507
01:15:22,135 --> 01:15:24,286
Hey, just show me the video
Prathapan sir just showed us.

1508
01:15:25,786 --> 01:15:26,786
Is this the one?

1509
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:28,953
Hey, isn't it Krishnaveni?

1510
01:15:29,132 --> 01:15:30,453
Yes, it's true.

1511
01:15:31,437 --> 01:15:33,584
Madam, do you hear me?
- 'Sir, I don't. Network...'

1512
01:15:33,664 --> 01:15:36,123
Have you come to Kochi in April?

1513
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:37,789
On twelfth April?
- 'Yes, sir.'

1514
01:15:37,869 --> 01:15:39,967
'I had an interview
there in Medicity.'

1515
01:15:40,047 --> 01:15:41,539
All of these nine people,

1516
01:15:41,619 --> 01:15:44,123
had been in Kochi some day
in between April 15-30th,

1517
01:15:44,203 --> 01:15:45,528
for various purposes.

1518
01:15:45,608 --> 01:15:47,869
But all of them had checked-in
to the Pluto mall.

1519
01:15:47,949 --> 01:15:50,619
'Yes, yes, I had gone to
the Pluto mall.'

1520
01:16:22,294 --> 01:16:23,703
Sir, this is a lucky contest.

1521
01:16:23,783 --> 01:16:25,289
If you fill in your name
and address...

1522
01:16:25,369 --> 01:16:27,203
You might win it.
- Thanks.

1523
01:16:27,283 --> 01:16:29,286
Pen?
- No, I'll do it later.

1524
01:16:36,786 --> 01:16:38,456
What's it?
- Dasan. I'm down.

1525
01:16:38,536 --> 01:16:39,945
I'll come, be there.

1526
01:16:53,926 --> 01:16:54,977
What's the matter?

1527
01:16:55,130 --> 01:16:57,244
See this, this is a contest
conducted in here.

1528
01:16:57,324 --> 01:16:59,289
It contains all the details of
a person like the name,

1529
01:16:59,369 --> 01:17:01,164
address, mobile number,
e-mail id and occupation.

1530
01:17:01,244 --> 01:17:02,081
So what?

1531
01:17:02,161 --> 01:17:04,248
Aren't these details more than
enough to easily trick someone?

1532
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:07,001
What you are saying? That this is
connected to the job fraud case?

1533
01:17:07,081 --> 01:17:08,998
Why not? It contains A to Z
about a person.

1534
01:17:09,078 --> 01:17:10,661
That's in last April, dear.

1535
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:13,912
You come, let's ask about it.

1536
01:17:14,078 --> 01:17:16,206
If you have an alternate number,
write that too.

1537
01:17:16,286 --> 01:17:17,453
Brother.
- Hi, sir.

1538
01:17:17,661 --> 01:17:20,789
Will it win?
- Of course, if your time is good.

1539
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:23,706
No way, I didn't win anything
for the Vishu contest last time.

1540
01:17:23,786 --> 01:17:25,539
Sir, how many contests have
passed after April?

1541
01:17:25,619 --> 01:17:26,953
You will win this for sure.

1542
01:17:28,789 --> 01:17:31,164
Pal, you call Krishnaveni,

1543
01:17:31,244 --> 01:17:34,619
and ask her if she had filled any
coupon when she visited Pluto mall.

1544
01:17:35,925 --> 01:17:37,203
Hello.
- Sir.

1545
01:17:37,661 --> 01:17:39,983
Dear, when you came to Pluto mall,

1546
01:17:40,063 --> 01:17:43,578
did you fill any coupon for
a contest or something?

1547
01:17:44,513 --> 01:17:47,789
Yes, I had filled one for my sister.

1548
01:17:47,869 --> 01:17:50,547
Later, I filled one for
myself, and put it inside.

1549
01:17:50,627 --> 01:17:51,518
Oh, really?

1550
01:18:04,957 --> 01:18:06,119
Brother, brother...

1551
01:18:06,453 --> 01:18:08,164
Who's coordinating the contest?

1552
01:18:08,244 --> 01:18:09,498
The mall itself.

1553
01:18:09,578 --> 01:18:10,661
Why do you ask?

1554
01:18:10,911 --> 01:18:12,578
No, it's nothing...

1555
01:18:12,796 --> 01:18:16,608
We are the marketing staff of
Q-tec educational centre.

1556
01:18:17,036 --> 01:18:19,956
Is it possible to get the details of
the coupons filled by the visitors?

1557
01:18:20,036 --> 01:18:21,248
No, no, no, no...

1558
01:18:21,328 --> 01:18:23,789
If we can get the details of people
between the age of 15-20,

1559
01:18:23,869 --> 01:18:25,914
that will be very useful
for our marketing.

1560
01:18:25,994 --> 01:18:29,411
We are conducting this contest
only to give gifts to people.

1561
01:18:29,578 --> 01:18:31,828
And not for selling data.

1562
01:18:32,744 --> 01:18:34,498
Why are you manipulating things?

1563
01:18:34,578 --> 01:18:36,414
Sir, we can make a payment...

1564
01:18:36,494 --> 01:18:38,248
Can't you understand, what
I just said? Please go.

1565
01:18:38,328 --> 01:18:40,373
Sir, we ask you because
it's for our job...

1566
01:18:40,453 --> 01:18:42,039
Didn't I tell you once?

1567
01:18:42,119 --> 01:18:43,119
Go, man.

1568
01:18:43,994 --> 01:18:45,286
Get lost.

1569
01:18:50,119 --> 01:18:52,203
They are moving these
coupons somewhere.

1570
01:18:52,328 --> 01:18:53,289
That's for sure.

1571
01:18:53,369 --> 01:18:54,994
What are you saying?
I don't think so.

1572
01:18:55,453 --> 01:18:56,748
If so, we will do one thing.

1573
01:18:56,828 --> 01:18:59,078
We will inform our office about it.
Let them do the needful.

1574
01:18:59,244 --> 01:19:01,828
If we call them before confirming
it, Basheer sir will be little us.

1575
01:19:03,124 --> 01:19:04,560
What can we do now?

1576
01:19:05,786 --> 01:19:07,498
Were you the guy who came to
that office with the coupons?

1577
01:19:07,578 --> 01:19:08,539
What is it, sir?

1578
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:10,831
Who are you giving
these coupons to?

1579
01:19:10,911 --> 01:19:12,411
I swear I don't know.
- Bloody...

1580
01:19:12,578 --> 01:19:14,123
Tell me the truth.
We are from the Cyber Cell.

1581
01:19:14,203 --> 01:19:16,331
There's a complaint against you.
We will put you in jail.

1582
01:19:16,411 --> 01:19:18,854
I swear I don't know.
Every Friday, a van comes here.

1583
01:19:18,934 --> 01:19:20,119
I know only that.
- What time on Friday?

1584
01:21:58,578 --> 01:22:00,103
Why are you here?

1585
01:22:00,519 --> 01:22:01,778
Have you worn a hat and all?

1586
01:22:02,783 --> 01:22:04,367
Make it a full cup. Come on...

1587
01:22:05,075 --> 01:22:06,037
Take it.

1588
01:22:06,117 --> 01:22:07,662
Oh, sorry,
I don't drink milk tea.

1589
01:22:07,742 --> 01:22:09,245
Couldn't you say so before?
- I drink black tea.

1590
01:22:09,325 --> 01:22:11,287
Brother, order cancelled.
Black tea will make you even darker.

1591
01:22:11,367 --> 01:22:13,412
Sanu, where were you after coming
back from Selam? Long time...

1592
01:22:13,492 --> 01:22:16,578
My family forced me to
do M-Tech after B-Tech.

1593
01:22:16,658 --> 01:22:17,607
And did you take it up?

1594
01:22:17,687 --> 01:22:19,037
For that,
I need to pass B-tech, right?

1595
01:22:19,117 --> 01:22:20,787
Yes, you should pass B-tech.

1596
01:22:20,867 --> 01:22:22,867
What about you?
Did you find any job?

1597
01:22:22,992 --> 01:22:24,662
After B-tech,
we are looking over...

1598
01:22:24,742 --> 01:22:25,787
So, still jobless!

1599
01:22:25,867 --> 01:22:27,620
What about you?
Did you find a job?

1600
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:29,578
Yeah, we are on it,
investigating things.

1601
01:22:29,658 --> 01:22:30,912
Can't you try some simple stuff?

1602
01:22:30,992 --> 01:22:33,158
Like civil service or something.

1603
01:22:33,238 --> 01:22:34,325
How ridiculous!

1604
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:35,912
Yes, we are trying for it.

1605
01:22:35,992 --> 01:22:37,912
What I want to ask you is...

1606
01:22:37,992 --> 01:22:40,078
This data entry thing, right?

1607
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:41,495
Is it a good business?

1608
01:22:41,575 --> 01:22:44,162
I'm doing it as a part
time job, right?

1609
01:22:44,242 --> 01:22:46,283
I get two to three hundred per day.

1610
01:22:46,367 --> 01:22:48,948
If it is full-time, you will get
five to six. Do you want to give it a try?

1611
01:22:49,028 --> 01:22:50,953
That's not the plan...

1612
01:22:51,033 --> 01:22:53,895
The thing is, his uncle told us that
he can loan us some money.

1613
01:22:53,975 --> 01:22:57,492
If we start a business of your
kind, will it work out?

1614
01:22:58,283 --> 01:22:59,617
How does it run?

1615
01:22:59,825 --> 01:23:01,242
Can you make me your partner?

1616
01:23:01,408 --> 01:23:03,242
Yeah, that's possible.

1617
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:04,453
Tell me, what is my share?

1618
01:23:04,533 --> 01:23:05,787
The thing is...
- No, you fix my share first.

1619
01:23:05,867 --> 01:23:07,787
Let me tell you the matter.
- We will fight, fix my share.

1620
01:23:07,867 --> 01:23:09,033
Tell him something.

1621
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:10,908
I will tell you, fifty-fifty.

1622
01:23:11,367 --> 01:23:12,272
Are you okay with it?
- Yes.

1623
01:23:12,352 --> 01:23:13,275
Then, deal.
- Done.

1624
01:23:14,492 --> 01:23:15,783
I'll tell you how it runs.

1625
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:20,867
If you have a person's name, phone
number, address, and e-mail Id,

1626
01:23:21,398 --> 01:23:23,492
you will get four rupees, okay?

1627
01:23:23,575 --> 01:23:25,495
If you have the same person's
account number and pan card,

1628
01:23:25,575 --> 01:23:27,120
you will get eight rupees, okay?

1629
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,242
What the corporates want is Data.

1630
01:23:29,325 --> 01:23:31,287
So, we provide it for them,
what use we have with it?

1631
01:23:31,367 --> 01:23:33,120
Can you ask your uncle
to arrange ten systems?

1632
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,245
Which uncle?

1633
01:23:34,325 --> 01:23:36,101
Yes... I can.

1634
01:23:36,617 --> 01:23:38,283
You will need some twenty girls.

1635
01:23:38,575 --> 01:23:39,578
What are these girls for?

1636
01:23:39,658 --> 01:23:40,660
Can you arrange them?

1637
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:42,745
His uncle will arrange all those.
You tell me the matter.

1638
01:23:42,825 --> 01:23:45,370
If yes, we can play the naughty boss,
on a revolving chair.

1639
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:46,620
Very nice!

1640
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:48,426
Isn't it fun... To simply
lounge on a chair?

1641
01:23:48,506 --> 01:23:50,203
The data we collect, right?

1642
01:23:50,283 --> 01:23:51,908
Who will we give the data to?

1643
01:23:58,575 --> 01:23:59,867
Pay for my tea.

1644
01:24:00,825 --> 01:24:02,075
Take it from my share.

1645
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:13,203
It's from here, the data needed
for builders, car dealers,

1646
01:24:13,283 --> 01:24:14,870
private hospitals, schools,

1647
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:16,287
colleges, travel agencies,

1648
01:24:16,367 --> 01:24:18,412
and other business enterprises
in Kerala are sent.

1649
01:24:18,492 --> 01:24:20,953
They are sent outside Kerala
as well, through co-coordinators.

1650
01:24:21,033 --> 01:24:22,158
That's more money.

1651
01:24:22,533 --> 01:24:25,328
Buddy, what about my share?

1652
01:24:25,408 --> 01:24:27,867
Share is okay.
- We will set it up.

1653
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,745
Okay, then have it.

1654
01:24:29,825 --> 01:24:32,700
We send the data to this address
via courier.

1655
01:24:33,981 --> 01:24:37,544
They are again passed on
via. inter-state lorries.

1656
01:24:39,117 --> 01:24:41,355
Sir, what you said is right.

1657
01:24:41,435 --> 01:24:44,151
Once Kolamedu was famous
for theft and robbery.

1658
01:24:54,048 --> 01:24:56,662
They used to lie low in the
Bangalore-Coimbatore highways,

1659
01:24:56,742 --> 01:24:58,412
and rob the vehicles coming along...

1660
01:24:58,492 --> 01:24:59,783
That's been their
job for generations.

1661
01:25:02,025 --> 01:25:04,995
In 2002, when Ms Jayalalitha
was in power,

1662
01:25:05,075 --> 01:25:07,078
there were raids in Kolamedu.

1663
01:25:07,158 --> 01:25:08,950
A lot of them were
arrested back then.

1664
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:17,033
To an extent, Kolamedu had
stopped being a notorious place.

1665
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:20,448
Many of them were sent to quarters.

1666
01:25:20,528 --> 01:25:22,703
Later, nearly two hundred people
were given education.

1667
01:25:22,783 --> 01:25:25,617
But when they got an education, their
mode of theft changed.

1668
01:25:25,783 --> 01:25:28,120
They understood what
they can do with technology.

1669
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,170
Since then,
all the crimes reported,

1670
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:31,511
from Kolamedu are Cyber Crimes.

1671
01:25:33,325 --> 01:25:35,787
From 2012 onwards,
a lot of Cybercrimes have,

1672
01:25:35,867 --> 01:25:37,156
being reported from Kolamedu.

1673
01:25:37,236 --> 01:25:38,802
They are not big
hackers or anything.

1674
01:25:38,882 --> 01:25:40,069
But with the available data,

1675
01:25:40,149 --> 01:25:42,078
they call up people, convince
them in a short time,

1676
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:43,367
and steal money from them.

1677
01:25:43,447 --> 01:25:46,041
'You must have received
an OTP. Can you check...?

1678
01:25:46,121 --> 01:25:48,109
They don't fear anything or anyone.

1679
01:25:48,189 --> 01:25:51,717
They know that they won't have
anything to eat, if they have fear.

1680
01:25:51,797 --> 01:25:54,162
There is only one reason for
crimes and revolutions...

1681
01:25:54,242 --> 01:25:55,450
That's hunger.

1682
01:25:56,575 --> 01:25:58,908
Data is their primary requirement.

1683
01:26:02,805 --> 01:26:04,575
They get it through various sources.

1684
01:26:04,783 --> 01:26:07,883
That can be coupons,
photo copy of ID cards,

1685
01:26:07,963 --> 01:26:10,667
or it can be any of the content
we post on online platforms.

1686
01:26:10,747 --> 01:26:15,825
Irrespective of gender,
they are frauds.

1687
01:26:17,367 --> 01:26:21,870
The master brain behind forty per cent of Cyber
crimes in South India is Kolamedu.

1688
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:23,902
If we are not vigilant,

1689
01:26:23,982 --> 01:26:28,992
Kolamedu is as dangerous
as Jamtara in North India.

1690
01:26:29,242 --> 01:26:30,578
Being such a notorious place,

1691
01:26:30,658 --> 01:26:33,662
it's impossible to lock someone
up through an operation.

1692
01:26:33,742 --> 01:26:35,283
Even if you do it,

1693
01:26:35,619 --> 01:26:37,700
you won't be able
to cross Tamilnadu.

1694
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:43,456
See,

1695
01:26:43,536 --> 01:26:45,908
we have tracked the IP address from
which Alphonsa received the mail.

1696
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:49,783
It's from a server called Go daddy,
they bought that domain.

1697
01:26:49,863 --> 01:26:53,658
I had spoken to a technical
assistant from Go daddy.

1698
01:26:54,117 --> 01:26:55,995
They have forwarded an
IP address to us.

1699
01:26:56,075 --> 01:26:58,033
I have checked the details.

1700
01:26:58,113 --> 01:27:00,283
That's a Hyderabad based SIM.

1701
01:27:00,908 --> 01:27:02,537
Sir, we have got the call details.

1702
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:06,825
But when we tracked the IMEA of the
phone in which the SIM had been,

1703
01:27:06,905 --> 01:27:09,162
this phone has been active in
Selam-Bharmapuri region,

1704
01:27:09,242 --> 01:27:12,200
for the last four months using
another phone number.

1705
01:27:12,355 --> 01:27:14,950
I'll put the details on our
WhatsApp group.

1706
01:27:15,742 --> 01:27:16,783
Sir.

1707
01:27:27,533 --> 01:27:28,533
Sir.

1708
01:27:29,504 --> 01:27:30,870
Who is Aravind?

1709
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:31,912
It's me.

1710
01:27:31,992 --> 01:27:33,703
Who are you?
- Oh, you're a Mallu, huh?

1711
01:27:33,783 --> 01:27:35,617
Just a minute.
Can you come out?

1712
01:27:35,867 --> 01:27:37,492
Tell me, what's the matter?

1713
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:40,828
Brother, that is... We want
to create a website.

1714
01:27:40,908 --> 01:27:42,095
No problem, we can do it.

1715
01:27:42,175 --> 01:27:43,870
But there's a complication in it.

1716
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:46,578
Nobody should be able
to track its IP address,

1717
01:27:46,765 --> 01:27:47,912
No, we will not do that.

1718
01:27:47,992 --> 01:27:50,745
Please, please, please, brother...
Don't go, please don't say that.

1719
01:27:50,825 --> 01:27:53,162
We will pay you well,
please...

1720
01:27:53,242 --> 01:27:54,533
Please do it for us, brother.

1721
01:27:59,658 --> 01:28:00,867
Come on, brother.

1722
01:28:01,492 --> 01:28:02,787
It is risky.

1723
01:28:02,867 --> 01:28:05,450
The police will easily
track the IP address.

1724
01:28:05,533 --> 01:28:07,787
If the police catch us,
it's going to be hell.

1725
01:28:07,867 --> 01:28:09,828
We know you do this,
that's why we're here.

1726
01:28:09,908 --> 01:28:12,200
You will have no problem
because of this, brother.

1727
01:28:12,575 --> 01:28:15,284
We can pay you any amount
of money you need.

1728
01:28:15,450 --> 01:28:16,617
How much?

1729
01:28:17,075 --> 01:28:18,200
You may tell…

1730
01:28:19,742 --> 01:28:20,953
Forty?

1731
01:28:21,348 --> 01:28:22,611
Possible?
- I...

1732
01:28:23,243 --> 01:28:24,658
Okay, brother, forty thousand is fine.

1733
01:28:24,992 --> 01:28:26,575
What kind of website do you need?
Tell me.

1734
01:28:26,742 --> 01:28:29,825
Brother, there's a hospital
in Ireland called Supernova.

1735
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:31,783
Its website...

1736
01:28:31,867 --> 01:28:33,828
No, that's not possible.
- It's nothing, dear.

1737
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:35,787
Just change the 'V' to 'W'.
That's all.

1738
01:28:35,867 --> 01:28:37,995
Who're you?
- Just to knock over a few nurses.

1739
01:28:38,075 --> 01:28:39,203
Come on...
- No, brother.

1740
01:28:39,283 --> 01:28:41,742
Come on, let's go over a few...
We will pay you well.

1741
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:43,950
Stop there.

1742
01:28:56,992 --> 01:29:00,033
We know the number using
which you accessed the domain.

1743
01:29:00,393 --> 01:29:02,578
We have the evidence
for all the frauds,

1744
01:29:02,658 --> 01:29:04,441
You have been committing on
mobile and laptop,

1745
01:29:04,521 --> 01:29:07,825
since dropping out of
Srikrishna College, Hyderabad.

1746
01:29:08,075 --> 01:29:10,037
You don't know the Kerala Police.

1747
01:29:10,117 --> 01:29:11,703
We know how to make
you speak the truth.

1748
01:29:11,783 --> 01:29:13,492
Isn't because he
doesn't know us?

1749
01:29:13,617 --> 01:29:16,203
Joy, I don't think this will
be necessary. He will confess.

1750
01:29:16,283 --> 01:29:17,287
Tell me, brother.

1751
01:29:17,367 --> 01:29:19,450
I just created a website for them.

1752
01:29:19,696 --> 01:29:20,662
I don't know anything else.

1753
01:29:20,914 --> 01:29:22,575
For whom? Tell me...

1754
01:29:23,742 --> 01:29:24,700
Tell me, I say.

1755
01:29:26,283 --> 01:29:27,575
Just spit it out, you...

1756
01:29:29,666 --> 01:29:32,808
'Simbon, a fraudster
in Kolamedu Colony.'

1757
01:29:32,888 --> 01:29:35,720
'He eked out a living by uploading
hidden videos in porn sites.'

1758
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,816
'There's a case against him
regarding the same.'

1759
01:29:39,363 --> 01:29:40,488
'He is Michael.'

1760
01:29:40,568 --> 01:29:42,912
'Everyone calls him, 'Vellayan'.'

1761
01:29:42,992 --> 01:29:45,033
'His plus point is his physique.'

1762
01:29:45,261 --> 01:29:47,366
'Simbon is his main helper.'

1763
01:29:47,544 --> 01:29:48,949
'Michael is the one who
plans everything.'

1764
01:29:49,029 --> 01:29:50,449
'And Simbon arranges people.'

1765
01:29:50,658 --> 01:29:52,863
'Execution is carried out
by his wife, Jaya.'

1766
01:29:53,322 --> 01:29:55,029
'They are the people who
sell lies for their living.'

1767
01:29:55,113 --> 01:29:57,071
'It's very difficult to win
against them.'

1768
01:30:13,469 --> 01:30:15,348
Antony, you should be careful.

1769
01:30:15,428 --> 01:30:17,686
The phone should never
get disconnected.

1770
01:30:26,219 --> 01:30:27,136
Basheer,

1771
01:30:27,428 --> 01:30:29,280
I'll take care of this,
you leave.

1772
01:30:40,087 --> 01:30:44,219
Catching someone inside
the colony is not that easy.

1773
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:47,764
Once you are inside the colony,
you should be very alert.

1774
01:30:47,844 --> 01:30:50,848
Your fear doesn't show up
on your eyes.

1775
01:30:51,003 --> 01:30:53,636
Once you are there,
the game is yours.

1776
01:30:53,928 --> 01:30:56,681
Nothing should go out of our plans.

1777
01:30:56,828 --> 01:30:59,261
Aneesh, Mark 2, be alert.

1778
01:31:05,118 --> 01:31:06,048
It's nothing, brother.

1779
01:31:06,128 --> 01:31:08,719
But a matter of changing
a loop in a Java code.

1780
01:31:09,110 --> 01:31:11,853
We do coding work in a
company in Tamilnadu.

1781
01:31:11,933 --> 01:31:13,386
Which company?
- MCS.

1782
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:14,808
In Chennai.

1783
01:31:14,888 --> 01:31:16,886
Where in Chennai?
- In Tea Nagar.

1784
01:31:18,091 --> 01:31:19,903
Okay, tell me the plan.

1785
01:31:19,983 --> 01:31:22,803
The plan is, there are 223 accounts.

1786
01:31:23,116 --> 01:31:25,931
We are going to withdraw one lakh
each from these accounts,

1787
01:31:26,011 --> 01:31:27,223
between 2 am to 3 am.

1788
01:31:27,303 --> 01:31:30,469
But, we need an account to
keep the amount safe.

1789
01:31:30,969 --> 01:31:33,809
Nobody should be able
to track this account.

1790
01:31:33,889 --> 01:31:36,011
How much will you pay us?
- You may tell, brother.

1791
01:31:39,472 --> 01:31:40,641
Can you give fifty...?

1792
01:31:41,804 --> 01:31:42,844
Okay, that's fine.

1793
01:31:44,322 --> 01:31:45,422
We can do it.

1794
01:31:45,650 --> 01:31:48,380
Will it become a problem later?
Is it safe?

1795
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:50,139
You needn't worry about anything.

1796
01:31:50,219 --> 01:31:53,908
We will send the amount you give
to various accounts abroad.

1797
01:31:53,988 --> 01:31:57,199
We have more than twenty accounts
of our people there.

1798
01:31:57,279 --> 01:31:59,304
Okay.
- Once the deal is over,

1799
01:31:59,384 --> 01:32:01,342
the money will come to
your account safely.

1800
01:32:01,765 --> 01:32:02,880
When are you going to do it?

1801
01:32:03,772 --> 01:32:05,488
Probably next week, brother.

1802
01:32:05,568 --> 01:32:07,993
Next week... Let me see.

1803
01:32:08,073 --> 01:32:09,632
Hey, come here.
- Sir.

1804
01:32:16,884 --> 01:32:18,592
Are they your acquaintance?

1805
01:32:19,042 --> 01:32:20,191
If you show them to us,

1806
01:32:20,271 --> 01:32:23,195
we will make sure that you
are out of harm's way.

1807
01:32:23,759 --> 01:32:24,840
Speak up.

1808
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,028
At least, you're a Mallu, right?

1809
01:32:27,997 --> 01:32:29,580
Show some loyalty to your folks.

1810
01:32:33,621 --> 01:32:34,830
Yes, I know them.

1811
01:32:34,955 --> 01:32:36,121
'Step one.'

1812
01:32:36,288 --> 01:32:38,080
'They sell lies for a living.'

1813
01:32:38,298 --> 01:32:40,830
'So, we also need to tell lies
to win against them.'

1814
01:32:41,871 --> 01:32:43,830
'If you carry fear in your heart...'

1815
01:32:44,330 --> 01:32:46,455
'You become one among them.'

1816
01:32:46,974 --> 01:32:48,788
'We will be there around you.'

1817
01:32:48,955 --> 01:32:50,330
'Just at a striking distance.'

1818
01:32:57,697 --> 01:32:59,413
Ravi, you cover that side.

1819
01:33:03,915 --> 01:33:06,225
You be here. Let me talk
to him, and come.

1820
01:33:13,554 --> 01:33:16,668
Michael! Hey Michael!
- Brother, let's go.

1821
01:33:16,884 --> 01:33:19,209
If they catch us, they will
not leave us alive.

1822
01:33:19,609 --> 01:33:21,371
What?
- I told you, right?

1823
01:33:21,451 --> 01:33:22,728
Have they come?
- They are here.

1824
01:33:22,808 --> 01:33:24,205
They will kill us.

1825
01:33:25,437 --> 01:33:27,305
Who? Who are those guys?

1826
01:33:28,011 --> 01:33:29,124
They are the party.

1827
01:33:29,204 --> 01:33:30,319
Did you brief them about
our conditions?

1828
01:33:30,399 --> 01:33:31,508
Yes. All okay.

1829
01:33:31,588 --> 01:33:32,649
They agreed?
- I told them.

1830
01:33:32,729 --> 01:33:35,728
Can we trust them?
- Yes. Come! You lock the door.

1831
01:33:36,957 --> 01:33:38,291
'Once you meet Michael,'

1832
01:33:38,371 --> 01:33:40,044
'you should bring him
out of the colony,'

1833
01:33:40,124 --> 01:33:42,163
'pretending to talk about the deal.'

1834
01:33:52,378 --> 01:33:54,080
Come, let's talk.

1835
01:34:01,455 --> 01:34:02,538
Hey!

1836
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:31,716
Who are you?
Police, huh?

1837
01:34:32,336 --> 01:34:33,615
You have put a conference
call and all, huh?

1838
01:34:34,097 --> 01:34:35,473
Are you trying to cheat us?

1839
01:34:36,354 --> 01:34:38,038
If you are sure, you will get caught...

1840
01:34:38,913 --> 01:34:39,872
Dasan...

1841
01:34:50,921 --> 01:34:52,229
Hey, Michael.

1842
01:34:52,982 --> 01:34:54,080
Come on, run...

1843
01:34:55,099 --> 01:34:58,328
Stop there! Muthu!
Sarvana! Catch them!

1844
01:34:58,408 --> 01:35:00,688
They are running away. Catch them.
- Come on, man.

1845
01:35:01,763 --> 01:35:03,996
Look there!
- This side!

1846
01:35:04,309 --> 01:35:07,163
Sir, they are trapped,
get the vehicle here.

1847
01:35:09,413 --> 01:35:11,799
'The moment you decide
not to get killed,'

1848
01:35:12,395 --> 01:35:13,996
'is the moment we start winning...'

1849
01:35:14,371 --> 01:35:16,455
'We must play beyond
their expectation.'

1850
01:35:16,746 --> 01:35:19,288
'They must be horrified at
every twist we create.'

1851
01:35:22,797 --> 01:35:23,896
Stop.

1852
01:35:23,976 --> 01:35:25,081
'Step two.'

1853
01:35:25,306 --> 01:35:29,657
'Lure the lone wolf into our trap.'
- Catch him!

1854
01:35:29,913 --> 01:35:32,144
'They come unaware of the trap,'

1855
01:35:32,502 --> 01:35:34,985
'that is set by the one and
only Kerala Police.'

1856
01:35:35,441 --> 01:35:38,205
'Does anyone think that the
Kerala police is worthless?'

1857
01:35:47,996 --> 01:35:49,012
Sir, Mark 2.

1858
01:35:49,092 --> 01:35:51,122
I'm at Mark 2, come
with the vehicle.

1859
01:35:51,869 --> 01:35:53,066
Catch him.

1860
01:35:53,146 --> 01:35:57,163
Get in, you swine. Take him in.

1861
01:35:57,243 --> 01:35:59,830
Take the vehicle, move.

1862
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:02,999
Punch him!
- Tie him up.

1863
01:36:03,079 --> 01:36:03,917
Stay still, rascal!

1864
01:36:03,997 --> 01:36:05,792
Sir, Antony has not gotten in.

1865
01:36:06,352 --> 01:36:07,621
He will manage himself.

1866
01:36:07,701 --> 01:36:09,079
Don't stop the vehicle.
Go fast.

1867
01:36:09,159 --> 01:36:11,613
Sir, stop the vehicle.

1868
01:36:14,096 --> 01:36:16,580
Hey Dasan... Open the door.

1869
01:36:17,529 --> 01:36:19,535
Open the door!
- Anthony!

1870
01:36:20,353 --> 01:36:21,348
Get in! Come on!

1871
01:36:21,828 --> 01:36:24,077
Get him inside the van.

1872
01:36:24,157 --> 01:36:27,908
Get into the van!
- Antony, come on...

1873
01:36:28,145 --> 01:36:30,956
Come on! Get in!

1874
01:36:31,996 --> 01:36:33,461
Let's go, sir.

1875
01:36:33,991 --> 01:36:37,040
You scoundrel! Come this side.

1876
01:36:39,892 --> 01:36:41,892
'Life just taught now is a lesson.'

1877
01:36:42,565 --> 01:36:44,690
'The moment you decide
not to give up...'

1878
01:36:45,106 --> 01:36:46,356
'is the moment you start winning.'

1879
01:36:47,373 --> 01:36:50,720
'The society measures success
of a person by his job.'

1880
01:36:51,827 --> 01:36:55,563
'When rich or poor comes
to Cyber Cell and cry...'

1881
01:36:55,969 --> 01:36:57,594
'There is one question to which
we don't get an answer.'

1882
01:36:58,321 --> 01:36:59,584
'What is right among these?'

1883
01:37:08,182 --> 01:37:10,932
The Cyber Forensic report
came last week.

1884
01:37:11,317 --> 01:37:13,598
It's in Janaki's favour.

1885
01:37:14,098 --> 01:37:17,640
But... Since it was not acceptable
to her daughter and family...

1886
01:37:18,052 --> 01:37:20,973
When I saw her crying in front
of our sirs...

1887
01:37:21,807 --> 01:37:22,935
I felt really bad.

1888
01:37:23,015 --> 01:37:26,432
That's why I decided to come
and say it, though it's late.

1889
01:37:27,807 --> 01:37:29,685
Dear girl, that video is not hers.

1890
01:37:29,765 --> 01:37:32,140
I don't want to hear anything.
- Just a minute, let me say a thing.

1891
01:37:35,057 --> 01:37:36,598
It was a few years back.

1892
01:37:37,436 --> 01:37:40,473
A few girls from St. Teresa's
college went on a trip to Ooty.

1893
01:37:41,265 --> 01:37:43,432
There was a guy there,
a room boy...

1894
01:37:44,596 --> 01:37:46,352
He took the video of
a girl while bathing,

1895
01:37:46,432 --> 01:37:48,557
using a candid camera,
and made it viral.

1896
01:37:49,515 --> 01:37:52,682
There was no WhatsApp
or Facebook back then.

1897
01:37:53,307 --> 01:37:56,515
Still, people watched it on their
small phones.

1898
01:37:57,598 --> 01:37:58,973
It was in 2010.

1899
01:37:59,057 --> 01:38:00,432
You would have read it in
newspapers.

1900
01:38:01,399 --> 01:38:02,818
That girl...

1901
01:38:03,147 --> 01:38:05,283
She jumped from
the college building.

1902
01:38:06,432 --> 01:38:07,515
She died.

1903
01:38:10,039 --> 01:38:11,509
She was my sister.

1904
01:38:12,616 --> 01:38:13,948
My elder sister.

1905
01:38:17,382 --> 01:38:18,757
Dear girl,

1906
01:38:19,172 --> 01:38:21,848
I know the pain of
being left alone.

1907
01:38:23,211 --> 01:38:25,269
You should call your mom back.

1908
01:38:27,098 --> 01:38:28,468
I'm leaving.

1909
01:38:56,057 --> 01:38:57,973
The tea is awesome.
Have it.

1910
01:38:59,343 --> 01:39:00,810
Where were you? How long
have I been calling you?

1911
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:02,223
Why aren't you picking my calls?

1912
01:39:02,973 --> 01:39:04,393
I want to tell you something.

1913
01:39:04,473 --> 01:39:05,477
What is it?

1914
01:39:05,557 --> 01:39:06,935
Did anyone else trick you?

1915
01:39:07,099 --> 01:39:08,515
How much money did you lose?

1916
01:39:10,518 --> 01:39:11,973
A marriage proposal has come for me.

1917
01:39:14,765 --> 01:39:15,807
He is in Canada.

1918
01:39:17,596 --> 01:39:18,848
He is older to me.

1919
01:39:19,187 --> 01:39:22,659
Still, they have promised
me a nursing job there.

1920
01:39:31,099 --> 01:39:33,057
I had spoken about
you in my family.

1921
01:39:35,473 --> 01:39:39,807
But, my dad is not able to accept a
guy with a temporary job.

1922
01:39:52,098 --> 01:39:53,683
What should I do now?

1923
01:39:54,307 --> 01:39:57,661
You do whatever you
feel is good for you.

1924
01:40:12,543 --> 01:40:13,835
Where is your better half?

1925
01:40:15,418 --> 01:40:16,543
Your friend!

1926
01:40:17,245 --> 01:40:18,085
I don't know, sir.

1927
01:40:18,585 --> 01:40:19,543
What did you say?

1928
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:20,901
I don't know, sir.

1929
01:40:20,981 --> 01:40:22,130
How could you give it a miss?

1930
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:23,755
Is it at your whims and fancies,
you come for the duty shift?

1931
01:40:23,835 --> 01:40:25,418
Just good at buttering
your seniors.

1932
01:40:26,085 --> 01:40:27,421
A bunch of temporary-beggars.

1933
01:40:27,501 --> 01:40:29,543
And there are a few officers
to entertain them.

1934
01:40:29,668 --> 01:40:31,963
Sir, if at all you want to say
something, say it on my face.

1935
01:40:32,118 --> 01:40:33,626
Don't mutter, instead.

1936
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:35,043
What?

1937
01:40:35,626 --> 01:40:36,626
What did you say?

1938
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:40,085
If I tell it on your face,
will you f**k me up?

1939
01:40:40,444 --> 01:40:41,505
Yes, I might do it.

1940
01:40:41,585 --> 01:40:43,088
It's been some time since you
have been at odds with us.

1941
01:40:43,168 --> 01:40:44,296
What are you itching
for when you see us?

1942
01:40:44,376 --> 01:40:46,088
You don't have to stop my itching.
Who the hell are you?

1943
01:40:46,168 --> 01:40:48,171
It's been some time... Why
do you always scorn us?

1944
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:49,630
My office, I will talk
whatever I wish.

1945
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:51,255
What will you talk?
- Pass the test and get the job

1946
01:40:51,335 --> 01:40:53,210
instead of wooing the officers, and...
- Basheer.

1947
01:40:54,251 --> 01:40:55,293
Stop it.

1948
01:40:55,373 --> 01:40:57,335
This is not a place to
massage your ego.

1949
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:58,671
This is the Cyber Cell.
- He is messing with me.

1950
01:40:58,751 --> 01:41:00,460
Enough, stop it.
I told you already.

1951
01:41:01,043 --> 01:41:02,251
Antony, you come here.

1952
01:41:03,585 --> 01:41:05,751
I have saved another
ploy for you.

1953
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:11,126
What's all these, dear?

1954
01:41:11,501 --> 01:41:13,126
Sir, who are we in here?

1955
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:14,668
What we are doing is
also, a job, right?

1956
01:41:15,043 --> 01:41:17,338
Why is he showing partiality
in the workplace?

1957
01:41:17,418 --> 01:41:18,418
Sit here.

1958
01:41:21,543 --> 01:41:23,168
Dear, what's your problem?

1959
01:41:24,668 --> 01:41:25,876
I'm fed up, sir.

1960
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:27,921
When she found a guy in Canada,

1961
01:41:28,001 --> 01:41:29,668
I became 'temporary' for her.

1962
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:33,043
This has been my life...

1963
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:34,876
I have been 'temporary'
everywhere.

1964
01:41:35,251 --> 01:41:37,168
Dear, this is not the actual life.

1965
01:41:37,418 --> 01:41:38,751
This is not love, either.

1966
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:40,960
Let people who want
to go just go.

1967
01:41:41,562 --> 01:41:43,085
How old are you?

1968
01:41:44,001 --> 01:41:45,001
Twenty five years!

1969
01:41:45,376 --> 01:41:49,793
Whatever you see from your 15-25
years of age would be temporary.

1970
01:41:50,751 --> 01:41:55,043
You know, I was 26 years old when I
wrote my first PSC test.

1971
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:57,338
In the examination hall,

1972
01:41:57,418 --> 01:42:01,210
there was a girl next to my bench,
writing the examination.

1973
01:42:01,876 --> 01:42:03,168
A very nice girl.

1974
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:06,210
I kept looking at her
for a long time.

1975
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:07,682
She was doing a lot
of mental calculation,

1976
01:42:07,762 --> 01:42:09,081
and writing so seriously.

1977
01:42:09,585 --> 01:42:11,338
I prayed in the hall,

1978
01:42:11,418 --> 01:42:13,668
that if at all I marry,
I must marry a girl like her.

1979
01:42:15,126 --> 01:42:18,630
After the examination,
I waited for her in the verandah.

1980
01:42:18,710 --> 01:42:21,251
Just to see her, to talk to her...

1981
01:42:22,338 --> 01:42:24,751
Can you imagine what I saw?

1982
01:42:25,876 --> 01:42:28,126
Her dad was coming out,
carrying her all by himself.

1983
01:42:29,335 --> 01:42:31,727
I realised her lower
body is paralysed,

1984
01:42:31,807 --> 01:42:33,001
I felt a respect for her.

1985
01:42:33,668 --> 01:42:35,460
That respect is what
is called love.

1986
01:42:40,876 --> 01:42:42,088
Joy, did you leave the office?

1987
01:42:42,168 --> 01:42:43,755
No, I haven't left yet.

1988
01:42:43,835 --> 01:42:44,880
Did you buy Mom's medicine?

1989
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:46,338
I will come only after
buying the medicine.

1990
01:42:46,418 --> 01:42:47,463
Do you know the name of
the medicine?

1991
01:42:47,543 --> 01:42:49,338
That's for mom to eat
tonight, right? - 'Yes.'

1992
01:42:49,418 --> 01:42:50,671
Has mom slept?
- 'Have you taken the prescription?'

1993
01:42:50,751 --> 01:42:51,880
No, I have the prescription with me.

1994
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:54,505
'Why do you make it late?'
- I got tied up talking to him.

1995
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:56,171
'Don't get too late, okay?'

1996
01:42:56,251 --> 01:42:57,720
I'm leaving.
- 'Okay.'

1997
01:42:57,918 --> 01:42:59,046
I'm leaving, okay?
- 'Did you eat anything?'

1998
01:42:59,126 --> 01:43:00,626
No, I'll eat only after
coming home.

1999
01:43:01,126 --> 01:43:02,043
Okay, then.

2000
01:43:04,101 --> 01:43:06,626
Antony, did you eat anything?

2001
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:08,509
No, sir I will eat.

2002
01:43:08,794 --> 01:43:10,755
I'll order it for you.
Eat first, and then start your duty.

2003
01:43:10,835 --> 01:43:11,751
Good night.

2004
01:43:23,321 --> 01:43:24,526
'Honey, did you eat anything?'

2005
01:43:24,606 --> 01:43:26,171
No, mom, I just got home.

2006
01:43:26,251 --> 01:43:28,242
'You should have cooked something?'

2007
01:43:28,322 --> 01:43:30,005
I'm too tired to cook now.

2008
01:43:30,085 --> 01:43:31,255
I ordered food.

2009
01:43:31,335 --> 01:43:33,626
'Listen, you and Alby will come
on Saturday, right?'

2010
01:43:33,793 --> 01:43:35,630
Let me see if we can
come on Saturday.

2011
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:38,001
Alby's leave is still not confirmed.

2012
01:43:38,918 --> 01:43:40,088
'What's wrong?'

2013
01:43:40,168 --> 01:43:41,463
A cockroach jumped out
from the fridge.

2014
01:43:41,543 --> 01:43:42,588
'Oh, is that all?'

2015
01:43:42,959 --> 01:43:43,880
I got scared.

2016
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:46,543
'Grandpa was telling me about
Ancy's marriage.'

2017
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,710
'Most probably, it will be conducted
before Easter.'

2018
01:43:49,001 --> 01:43:50,376
'Is it Alby's time home?'

2019
01:43:52,329 --> 01:43:54,588
He told me that
he would be late today.

2020
01:43:54,668 --> 01:43:58,210
'Dear, when Alby comes, remind
him of our LIC thing.'

2021
01:43:58,918 --> 01:44:00,796
Shucks! One minute mom...
I'll call you back.

2022
01:44:00,876 --> 01:44:02,835
'What happened?'
- Our electricity went out.

2023
01:44:51,906 --> 01:44:53,073
'Control Bravo 18.'

2024
01:44:53,489 --> 01:44:55,198
'Bravo 18 control answering, sir.'

2025
01:44:56,328 --> 01:44:59,781
'Can you tell us the exact location
where the incident happened?'

2026
01:45:00,155 --> 01:45:02,839
'Sir, opposite Chaitram
Textiles, Irumbanam.'

2027
01:45:03,102 --> 01:45:04,673
'On the way to the colony,'

2028
01:45:04,753 --> 01:45:06,561
'close to the flat seen
on the right side.'

2029
01:45:06,641 --> 01:45:08,070
'The guards are
waiting over there. '

2030
01:45:09,150 --> 01:45:10,156
Sir.

2031
01:45:10,710 --> 01:45:11,734
'You must do something.'

2032
01:45:11,814 --> 01:45:13,580
'You must locate yourself so
that none of their folks,'

2033
01:45:13,660 --> 01:45:16,020
'enter the room where
the incident has happened.'

2034
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:17,088
What's the status?

2035
01:45:17,168 --> 01:45:18,870
The inquiry is on.
- What?

2036
01:45:19,274 --> 01:45:20,725
The inquiry is on.

2037
01:45:23,769 --> 01:45:25,685
Who are you?
- My name is Johnson.

2038
01:45:26,886 --> 01:45:28,136
Which flat do you occupy?

2039
01:45:28,345 --> 01:45:29,845
I'm the care taker in here.

2040
01:45:30,636 --> 01:45:31,928
Take out the register.

2041
01:45:40,511 --> 01:45:41,553
Hey, there is no recording in it?

2042
01:45:41,633 --> 01:45:43,598
Usually, no one from
outside comes here.

2043
01:45:43,678 --> 01:45:45,223
So, is the guy who came just
now, your acquaintance?

2044
01:45:45,303 --> 01:45:46,261
Oh, my Gosh!

2045
01:45:49,178 --> 01:45:50,511
That's not it, sir.

2046
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:52,720
What is your name?
- Sunil.

2047
01:45:53,198 --> 01:45:54,681
What?
- Sunil.

2048
01:45:54,761 --> 01:45:55,723
Where's your house?

2049
01:45:55,803 --> 01:45:57,220
At Irumbaram, sir.

2050
01:45:57,511 --> 01:45:58,390
Where in Irumbaram?

2051
01:45:58,470 --> 01:46:00,428
Under... Under the bridge.

2052
01:46:01,052 --> 01:46:02,390
How long have you been here?

2053
01:46:02,470 --> 01:46:05,015
Around... around four years.

2054
01:46:05,095 --> 01:46:06,265
Who is Joseph?

2055
01:46:06,345 --> 01:46:07,386
It's me, sir.

2056
01:46:11,636 --> 01:46:12,848
When did your duty get over?

2057
01:46:12,928 --> 01:46:14,306
At 9 o'clock, Sir.

2058
01:46:14,386 --> 01:46:15,928
I left early today.

2059
01:46:16,011 --> 01:46:18,681
My wife had called me saying
our kid was sick.

2060
01:46:18,761 --> 01:46:20,553
That's why I left home early.

2061
01:46:22,595 --> 01:46:23,928
When did you get
into your duty?

2062
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:27,265
I... I got late, sir.

2063
01:46:27,345 --> 01:46:28,761
What time, I'm asking.

2064
01:46:29,398 --> 01:46:31,678
Might be around... 11 o'clock.

2065
01:46:33,770 --> 01:46:36,470
So, you knew that there would be
no one here after 9 o'clock.

2066
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:38,556
Geez! That's not it.

2067
01:46:38,636 --> 01:46:39,803
That's not it, sir.
- Then?

2068
01:46:40,053 --> 01:46:41,261
I mean...

2069
01:46:41,579 --> 01:46:43,598
Hey, are you drunk?
- No, sir.

2070
01:46:43,678 --> 01:46:44,806
You come with me.
Let me ask you...

2071
01:46:44,886 --> 01:46:46,261
I'm not drunk, sir.

2072
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:48,678
Joseph.

2073
01:46:48,761 --> 01:46:50,553
Is it your church name?

2074
01:46:50,822 --> 01:46:51,806
Yes, sir.

2075
01:46:51,886 --> 01:46:54,261
What happened to the generator here?
- It gets busted, off and on.

2076
01:46:55,095 --> 01:46:56,306
Don't you have an association here?

2077
01:46:56,386 --> 01:46:57,845
Yes, sir. He is the secretary.

2078
01:46:58,267 --> 01:47:00,178
What is your name?
- My name's Paul.

2079
01:47:01,095 --> 01:47:03,098
Who are you?
- The Treasurer.

2080
01:47:03,178 --> 01:47:04,803
Name?
- Ashley.

2081
01:47:05,595 --> 01:47:06,935
Who is the lady's neighbour?

2082
01:47:07,015 --> 01:47:08,220
It's him.
- It's me.

2083
01:47:09,970 --> 01:47:11,431
Where were you when
the incident took place?

2084
01:47:11,511 --> 01:47:14,053
I was sleeping in my flat.
Where else am I supposed to go?

2085
01:47:14,511 --> 01:47:15,428
Smart!

2086
01:47:15,508 --> 01:47:18,011
Hey, you need not ask questions,
just answers will do.

2087
01:47:18,373 --> 01:47:19,556
What happened to the generator?

2088
01:47:19,636 --> 01:47:20,678
The diesel got over.

2089
01:47:20,970 --> 01:47:23,056
We have sent someone to buy
diesel, sir. He will come soon.

2090
01:47:23,136 --> 01:47:24,803
Did you take the CCTV
footage in here?

2091
01:47:24,970 --> 01:47:26,348
They have CCTV's.

2092
01:47:26,428 --> 01:47:27,845
But none of them are working.

2093
01:47:29,838 --> 01:47:31,848
No generator, no CCTV...

2094
01:47:31,928 --> 01:47:33,220
What association...

2095
01:47:34,511 --> 01:47:36,720
Thank God!
You, at least, have a generator.

2096
01:47:37,261 --> 01:47:39,265
Allow these people to go only
after collecting their details.

2097
01:47:39,345 --> 01:47:41,386
Why do you want my details?
What wrong did I do?

2098
01:47:42,886 --> 01:47:44,973
Something bizarre happens in
your flat, on your floor,

2099
01:47:45,053 --> 01:47:46,928
and you, the secretary, knows
nothing about it.

2100
01:47:48,011 --> 01:47:49,053
Do you get it?

2101
01:47:51,178 --> 01:47:52,636
You are not the
Chief Secretary, right?

2102
01:47:53,511 --> 01:47:54,491
My details needed?

2103
01:47:54,571 --> 01:47:56,053
Yes, give it to them in
writing and then leave.

2104
01:47:58,946 --> 01:48:00,011
What's up?

2105
01:48:01,595 --> 01:48:03,571
Sir, there's no rape attempt
or anything.

2106
01:48:03,651 --> 01:48:05,053
The motive is theft.

2107
01:48:05,464 --> 01:48:07,636
The lady's jewellery
has been stolen.

2108
01:48:08,177 --> 01:48:09,761
Sir, here's the lift.
- Let's walk up the stairs.

2109
01:48:10,136 --> 01:48:11,390
How's the lady now?

2110
01:48:11,470 --> 01:48:13,806
They admitted her in
the Medical Trust hospital,

2111
01:48:13,886 --> 01:48:16,261
as she has a blood clot behind
her head from the hit.

2112
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:17,738
Did you inform her husband?

2113
01:48:17,818 --> 01:48:21,220
It's her husband and her friends
who admitted her to the hospital.

2114
01:48:21,636 --> 01:48:23,307
Are any of our people
accompanying them? - Yes, sir.

2115
01:48:23,387 --> 01:48:25,181
Promod and Rajesh are
there in the hospital.

2116
01:48:25,261 --> 01:48:27,225
Ask them to update us
with every single thing.

2117
01:48:27,305 --> 01:48:28,235
Okay, sir.

2118
01:48:29,383 --> 01:48:30,428
Sir, it's over there.

2119
01:48:41,636 --> 01:48:43,636
I should never see you again
wearing this helmet of yours.

2120
01:48:43,845 --> 01:48:46,553
If you repeat this, I'll call your
customer care and give a complaint.

2121
01:49:01,845 --> 01:49:02,886
It's over there, sir.

2122
01:49:09,389 --> 01:49:11,223
Sir, it's from here she
was attacked first.

2123
01:49:11,303 --> 01:49:13,348
They must have dragged her out
this way...

2124
01:49:13,428 --> 01:49:15,190
A heavy tool must have been
employed to hit her.

2125
01:49:15,270 --> 01:49:16,660
That's why a lot of blood
has been lost.

2126
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:18,009
We have noted it in the report.

2127
01:49:21,185 --> 01:49:23,765
Have you got any clue regarding
the weapon used for the crime?

2128
01:49:23,845 --> 01:49:25,945
Sir, it should be something
like an iron rod.

2129
01:49:27,654 --> 01:49:29,654
Okay, I'm here at the crime spot.

2130
01:49:30,011 --> 01:49:31,803
Yes, yes, sir is here.

2131
01:49:31,928 --> 01:49:33,261
I'll tell him.

2132
01:49:34,489 --> 01:49:36,595
Sir, there was a call
from the hospital.

2133
01:49:36,745 --> 01:49:38,177
He is on ventilator.
- Is it?

2134
01:49:38,715 --> 01:49:40,791
Did you collect the left impression?

2135
01:49:41,154 --> 01:49:43,187
Sure! You stay there.

2136
01:49:43,542 --> 01:49:45,220
Are the ridges clear?
- No, Sir.

2137
01:49:45,756 --> 01:49:46,932
What if we look for
any vertical pattern?

2138
01:49:47,012 --> 01:49:48,845
He has stolen everything,
he could take.

2139
01:49:49,042 --> 01:49:50,720
We have collected the
finger prints.

2140
01:49:55,598 --> 01:49:57,181
What about her husband's details?

2141
01:49:57,261 --> 01:49:59,636
Alby, he's working in Info-park.

2142
01:50:09,738 --> 01:50:10,799
'Sruthi, tell me.'

2143
01:50:10,879 --> 01:50:11,823
Alby, did you leave from office?

2144
01:50:11,903 --> 01:50:14,072
'No, I told you, right?
That project of mine...'

2145
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:15,116
'What's it, dear?'

2146
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:17,962
Can you come over here fast?

2147
01:50:18,042 --> 01:50:19,336
'What happened?
Tell me the matter.'

2148
01:50:19,482 --> 01:50:20,845
Here, the electricity has gone out.

2149
01:50:20,925 --> 01:50:22,596
Why can't they switch on
the generator?

2150
01:50:22,676 --> 01:50:24,212
This has become a routine
these days.

2151
01:50:24,830 --> 01:50:26,465
'Dear Sruthi, what's the use of
calling me and saying all these?'

2152
01:50:26,545 --> 01:50:28,033
'You call the security,
and tell the matter.'

2153
01:50:28,113 --> 01:50:29,840
I don't know...
I'm getting scared.

2154
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:31,023
'What for?'

2155
01:50:31,103 --> 01:50:32,711
'You have food and go to bed.
I'll be there soon.'

2156
01:50:32,897 --> 01:50:34,965
It's for saying that I called you.

2157
01:50:35,045 --> 01:50:36,712
I had ordered food online.

2158
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,379
You should have seen
the aggression of the delivery boy.

2159
01:50:39,459 --> 01:50:40,928
'What happened?'
- He was wearing a helmet.

2160
01:50:41,008 --> 01:50:42,924
Haven't we told the association
several times,

2161
01:50:43,004 --> 01:50:44,543
not to let people
wearing helmet inside?

2162
01:50:44,623 --> 01:50:45,989
'Dear, isn't the security down?'

2163
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:48,465
'Sunil or Joseph
who's on duty today?'

2164
01:50:48,545 --> 01:50:49,629
Let me check.

2165
01:50:50,045 --> 01:50:51,170
Don't hang up.

2166
01:50:51,379 --> 01:50:52,587
'No, I won't.'

2167
01:50:53,170 --> 01:50:54,587
'Why are you so tense?'

2168
01:50:57,170 --> 01:50:58,879
I'll call you back, okay?

2169
01:50:59,087 --> 01:51:01,056
'What's the problem?'
- He's not gone until now.

2170
01:51:01,136 --> 01:51:02,462
'Who are you talking about?'

2171
01:51:09,795 --> 01:51:10,837
Sir.

2172
01:51:12,795 --> 01:51:14,587
Sir, we found a phone.

2173
01:51:16,295 --> 01:51:17,587
'Control Bravo 18.'

2174
01:51:17,879 --> 01:51:19,837
'Bravo control answering,
Sir. Over!'

2175
01:51:20,166 --> 01:51:23,813
'We have found a mobile phone from
the location, quite suspiciously.'

2176
01:51:24,021 --> 01:51:27,132
'Please send someone from
Cyber Cell to the location,'

2177
01:51:27,212 --> 01:51:30,165
'for collecting the
details of the same.'

2178
01:51:30,435 --> 01:51:32,116
'Control answering clear, sir.
Over!'

2179
01:51:41,972 --> 01:51:43,420
How long since I asked you here?

2180
01:51:44,629 --> 01:51:45,504
Sir...

2181
01:51:46,832 --> 01:51:48,129
For a case like this,

2182
01:51:48,492 --> 01:51:51,038
don't you have permanent
employees in the Cyber Cell?

2183
01:51:53,108 --> 01:51:55,795
Sir, the phone has been switched on.

2184
01:51:58,406 --> 01:51:59,879
Do I have to open the phone-lock?

2185
01:52:00,958 --> 01:52:02,087
Sorry, sir.

2186
01:52:09,382 --> 01:52:11,207
What an arrogant man!

2187
01:52:11,423 --> 01:52:14,960
Let's open the phone-lock.

2188
01:52:19,864 --> 01:52:21,551
Dude, it's not...

2189
01:52:28,196 --> 01:52:29,467
N...MM...

2190
01:53:11,045 --> 01:53:11,962
Hello.

2191
01:53:12,379 --> 01:53:13,837
Alby, have you reached?

2192
01:53:15,212 --> 01:53:16,337
Oh, friends are there too?

2193
01:53:17,587 --> 01:53:18,754
Should I come down?

2194
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:22,129
Food is here... but...
we will share anyway...

2195
01:53:32,888 --> 01:53:34,073
Sir.

2196
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:37,920
We have unlocked the phone.

2197
01:53:41,045 --> 01:53:43,379
Sir, we have some findings.

2198
01:53:43,545 --> 01:53:44,920
Shall we tell?

2199
01:53:45,879 --> 01:53:47,045
Findings?

2200
01:53:47,337 --> 01:53:48,382
What findings?

2201
01:53:48,462 --> 01:53:50,715
Sir, the lady spoke to her mom,

2202
01:53:50,795 --> 01:53:53,465
from 9.57 to 10.07 pm.

2203
01:53:53,545 --> 01:53:55,254
That has been recorded
in the phone.

2204
01:53:56,837 --> 01:53:59,920
She says that she has
ordered food online.

2205
01:54:01,141 --> 01:54:03,174
That is when the power goes.

2206
01:54:04,748 --> 01:54:07,382
Sir, after that... at 10.12 pm...

2207
01:54:07,462 --> 01:54:09,795
she talked to her husband.

2208
01:54:09,954 --> 01:54:11,407
That too has been recorded
in the phone.

2209
01:54:12,462 --> 01:54:15,137
'Why do you feel scared? Have
dinner and go to sleep. I'll come.'

2210
01:54:15,217 --> 01:54:19,069
'Honey, I called to talk to you
about it. I ordered food online.'

2211
01:54:19,149 --> 01:54:22,215
'You must have seen the
delivery guy. - What's wrong?

2212
01:54:22,295 --> 01:54:25,150
If our calculation is right...

2213
01:54:25,462 --> 01:54:29,205
The theft took place between
10.20 - 10.30 pm,

2214
01:54:31,658 --> 01:54:33,507
Find out who made
the food delivery here,

2215
01:54:33,587 --> 01:54:35,379
and collect his details.
- Sir.

2216
01:54:38,068 --> 01:54:39,587
I'll take the delivery boy's number.

2217
01:54:41,684 --> 01:54:42,795
Sanjiv sir.

2218
01:54:43,171 --> 01:54:45,215
I'm calling from the crime-spot.

2219
01:54:45,407 --> 01:54:46,834
I have sent you a number on WhatsApp.

2220
01:54:46,914 --> 01:54:48,254
Can you get me the
details of the same?

2221
01:54:48,504 --> 01:54:49,962
I'll track it down, and
call you soon.

2222
01:54:50,420 --> 01:54:53,087
Sir, please take the network
details of this number.

2223
01:54:58,962 --> 01:55:00,379
Sajiv sir.
- Antony.

2224
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:03,465
I have tracked down the details
of the number you sent.

2225
01:55:03,545 --> 01:55:05,425
The number is switched off
right now.

2226
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:07,930
Can you at least
send me the call list?

2227
01:55:08,010 --> 01:55:11,420
'The suspect's phone
is switched off.'

2228
01:55:11,879 --> 01:55:13,549
'When we inquired about
his history,'

2229
01:55:13,629 --> 01:55:15,504
'it seems like he's involved
in a few other crimes too.'

2230
01:55:15,941 --> 01:55:19,049
'The last call he made to a
number was at 11.15 pm.'

2231
01:55:19,129 --> 01:55:20,837
'The present tower location
of the number he called is,'

2232
01:55:21,186 --> 01:55:23,795
'Angamaly-Aluva road.
Sir, over!'

2233
01:55:25,442 --> 01:55:28,230
Dear hubby, my head's
aching like hell.

2234
01:55:28,310 --> 01:55:30,462
A vehicle is following us.

2235
01:55:31,938 --> 01:55:33,422
Is it a police vehicle, hubby?

2236
01:55:46,914 --> 01:55:48,504
Come outside.
- What is it, sir?

2237
01:55:48,907 --> 01:55:50,962
Just get out.
- What's the matter, sir?

2238
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:54,174
How are you related to Dany?

2239
01:55:54,254 --> 01:55:55,299
Which Dany, sir?

2240
01:55:55,379 --> 01:55:56,257
Which Dany?

2241
01:55:56,337 --> 01:55:59,174
You have spoken to him twice
in the last one hour.

2242
01:55:59,254 --> 01:56:00,712
Also chatted on WhatsApp.

2243
01:56:03,442 --> 01:56:04,487
Where is he right now?

2244
01:56:04,567 --> 01:56:06,795
Sir, I guess, you got me wrong.

2245
01:56:07,212 --> 01:56:08,670
I don't know this Dany.

2246
01:56:09,587 --> 01:56:10,712
This question is not
meant for you.

2247
01:56:13,178 --> 01:56:14,254
Tell me, madam.

2248
01:56:14,853 --> 01:56:16,004
Where is this Dany?

2249
01:56:18,587 --> 01:56:20,799
Why is he always talking to you?

2250
01:56:20,879 --> 01:56:22,712
I know him...

2251
01:56:22,837 --> 01:56:23,879
How do you know him?

2252
01:56:24,216 --> 01:56:27,462
He is a friend's brother.
- Which friend?

2253
01:56:27,807 --> 01:56:28,882
Kavitha David.

2254
01:56:28,962 --> 01:56:31,295
She and I were batchmates
in college.

2255
01:56:32,254 --> 01:56:35,337
What's the affair between you
and your batch mate's brother?

2256
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:36,420
Love?

2257
01:56:36,545 --> 01:56:38,003
No, sir... No.

2258
01:56:38,083 --> 01:56:39,924
Or any other extra
curricular activities?

2259
01:56:40,004 --> 01:56:41,117
It's nothing like that.

2260
01:56:41,197 --> 01:56:42,340
Then?

2261
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:45,087
He messages
and calls once in a while.

2262
01:56:45,645 --> 01:56:47,712
We are friends.

2263
01:56:49,645 --> 01:56:50,799
Okay.

2264
01:56:50,996 --> 01:56:53,004
What did he tell you when he
spoke to you for the last time?

2265
01:56:53,754 --> 01:56:58,332
He asked me if I can book
him a ticket to Mangalore.

2266
01:56:58,587 --> 01:56:59,863
For what?
- Just look for the train time.

2267
01:56:59,943 --> 01:57:01,410
I just know that there's
something wrong.

2268
01:57:01,490 --> 01:57:02,572
And not the details...

2269
01:57:02,652 --> 01:57:04,049
Did you book him the tickets?

2270
01:57:04,129 --> 01:57:05,125
No, sir.

2271
01:57:05,205 --> 01:57:07,276
He told he will go by bus.

2272
01:57:07,356 --> 01:57:10,465
Sir, there's a Kollur-Mookambika bus
from Ernakulam stand at 2.30.

2273
01:57:10,545 --> 01:57:12,030
That goes via. Mangalore.

2274
01:57:42,795 --> 01:57:45,132
Has the Mookambika bus going
via Mangalore reached?

2275
01:57:45,212 --> 01:57:46,545
No, sir. It's running late, today.

2276
01:57:46,856 --> 01:57:48,879
How long will it take?
- Another half an hour or more.

2277
01:57:59,754 --> 01:58:01,170
Sir, he might have gone
to the other side.

2278
01:58:06,212 --> 01:58:07,340
Hey, what's your name?

2279
01:58:07,420 --> 01:58:09,379
Sir, shall we check the CCTV
footage here?

2280
01:58:10,087 --> 01:58:11,129
Okay.

2281
01:58:23,837 --> 01:58:26,129
Sir, is there an exit that side?
Just show the lights there.

2282
01:58:26,212 --> 01:58:28,337
The railway police is there.
So, he won't go that way.

2283
01:58:48,254 --> 01:58:50,461
Just show the Cam B.
- Please zoom it.

2284
01:58:54,170 --> 01:58:56,011
He's the one...
- Wait, just pause.

2285
01:58:56,091 --> 01:58:57,754
Yes, sir.

2286
01:58:57,837 --> 01:58:58,879
See...

2287
01:58:59,539 --> 01:59:00,629
Is he the one?

2288
01:59:01,117 --> 01:59:02,970
Zoom it, please.
- Dasan, we found him.

2289
01:59:03,050 --> 01:59:04,924
Is he anywhere there?
- No, sir.

2290
01:59:05,004 --> 01:59:07,295
Sir, we found the guy.
He is there.

2291
02:00:25,943 --> 02:00:26,985
You are Dany, right?

2292
02:00:28,152 --> 02:00:29,155
Let's go?

2293
02:00:29,235 --> 02:00:30,235
What?

2294
02:00:33,402 --> 02:00:35,527
Stop there.
- Catch him.

2295
02:00:37,238 --> 02:00:39,995
Hold him!
- Sir, I have reformed now.

2296
02:00:40,075 --> 02:00:42,184
Sir, I'm telling you. I'm not my
old self.

2297
02:00:42,264 --> 02:00:44,377
Sir, please listen to me.

2298
02:00:44,457 --> 02:00:47,537
Let me go.
- Stay quiet.

2299
02:00:47,617 --> 02:00:49,710
Why did you catch me now?

2300
02:00:49,927 --> 02:00:52,776
Sir, please don't...
- You better confess...

2301
02:00:53,555 --> 02:00:56,371
Sir, I don't know anything.

2302
02:00:58,039 --> 02:01:01,277
Sir, I swear, I don't know anything.
- Check his mobile, sir.

2303
02:01:01,649 --> 02:01:03,401
I swear upon my mom,
I don't know anything, sir.

2304
02:01:03,481 --> 02:01:04,905
He knows everything,
just ask him, sir.

2305
02:01:04,985 --> 02:01:07,081
We have got proof confirming
that you have done it.

2306
02:01:07,161 --> 02:01:09,447
Don't try to make a
fool out of us.

2307
02:01:09,527 --> 02:01:10,568
Do you hear it?

2308
02:01:11,321 --> 02:01:13,163
I don't know anything about it.

2309
02:01:13,243 --> 02:01:16,402
We have got A-Z details of
your chat with your aunt.

2310
02:01:18,318 --> 02:01:19,485
Tell me the truth.

2311
02:01:20,402 --> 02:01:21,735
Tell me.

2312
02:01:22,902 --> 02:01:24,193
Tell me, you scumbag.

2313
02:01:24,485 --> 02:01:27,651
I'll tell you everything.
I'll say it...

2314
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:40,700
I had indeed gone to the
flat to deliver food.

2315
02:01:40,783 --> 02:01:43,620
But when I went there, I saw an
ambulance and a huge crowd.

2316
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:45,745
When I asked a guy about it,
he told me that,

2317
02:01:45,825 --> 02:01:47,578
a lady from the flat,
I had gone to,

2318
02:01:47,658 --> 02:01:49,245
deliver food has been
attacked by someone.

2319
02:01:49,325 --> 02:01:51,033
So, I didn't stay there any longer.

2320
02:01:51,116 --> 02:01:53,866
And, at the same time, I got a
food order from Vennala.

2321
02:01:54,116 --> 02:01:57,408
So, I went to Kakkanad, collected
food, and went directly to Vennala.

2322
02:01:57,575 --> 02:01:59,450
I go there often.

2323
02:01:59,575 --> 02:02:02,325
I know the old couple over
there very well.

2324
02:02:02,616 --> 02:02:06,033
But when I went there,
what I saw was...

2325
02:02:10,303 --> 02:02:11,219
Madam.

2326
02:02:20,779 --> 02:02:22,108
Madam.

2327
02:02:22,314 --> 02:02:26,284
Trust me, sir!
I don't know anything else.

2328
02:02:43,830 --> 02:02:44,955
Get him out.

2329
02:02:45,455 --> 02:02:46,747
Just get out, you...

2330
02:02:47,664 --> 02:02:48,527
Get walking.

2331
02:02:48,607 --> 02:02:49,710
Sir, please tell him.

2332
02:02:49,790 --> 02:02:50,831
Sir.

2333
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:53,145
Sir, I don't know anything.

2334
02:02:57,312 --> 02:02:59,688
Sir, please don't trap me in it.

2335
02:03:00,276 --> 02:03:01,312
Sir.

2336
02:03:16,970 --> 02:03:17,857
No, sir.

2337
02:03:17,937 --> 02:03:19,115
She is dead.

2338
02:03:21,814 --> 02:03:23,284
Sir, here he is.

2339
02:03:37,893 --> 02:03:41,271
'Control Bravo Team!'
- 'Control Bravo responding.'

2340
02:03:41,649 --> 02:03:45,581
'The accused has confessed
to murdering,'

2341
02:03:45,661 --> 02:03:50,353
'an additional person in the second
house from the church in Venella.'

2342
02:03:50,641 --> 02:03:52,976
'Send the officer in-charge?'

2343
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:54,760
'Yes, sir.'

2344
02:03:54,933 --> 02:03:57,592
'You mentioned the second
house from the Church at Venella'

2345
02:03:57,672 --> 02:03:59,841
'It's clear, sir. I'll inform.'
- 'Control Bravo!'

2346
02:03:59,921 --> 02:04:02,793
'We're sending two corpses
recovered from Venella.'

2347
02:04:03,106 --> 02:04:05,204
'Call me once you see it.'

2348
02:04:06,004 --> 02:04:07,355
This is also a theft, sir.

2349
02:04:07,435 --> 02:04:10,328
He has snatched the jewels
from the old lady.

2350
02:04:10,674 --> 02:04:13,344
It is definitely him.
He's trying to fool us.

2351
02:04:13,424 --> 02:04:14,976
Does he have any family
or relatives here?

2352
02:04:15,056 --> 02:04:16,219
Sir.
- None, sir.

2353
02:04:16,299 --> 02:04:19,243
The woman in the flat is dead, sir.
Rayeesha called.

2354
02:04:24,478 --> 02:04:28,046
We have got a few details
from her phone.

2355
02:04:28,237 --> 02:04:31,799
It is at 10.30 pm, she
has placed the order.

2356
02:04:31,879 --> 02:04:33,755
From the testimony we
got from the flat,

2357
02:04:33,835 --> 02:04:36,255
it is at 10.30 pm that lady
was taken to the hospital.

2358
02:04:36,335 --> 02:04:38,088
Given the details,
it's possible that,

2359
02:04:38,168 --> 02:04:40,588
Dany collected food from
the hotel at 10.15.

2360
02:04:41,211 --> 02:04:42,543
If that is true,

2361
02:04:42,918 --> 02:04:45,504
who delivered food to her,

2362
02:04:45,584 --> 02:04:46,946
in between the calls she made
to her mom and her husband?

2363
02:04:47,026 --> 02:04:49,936
From the time of the attack, and
the time that Dany said,

2364
02:04:50,016 --> 02:04:52,626
chances are less that he
did the crime.

2365
02:05:02,444 --> 02:05:04,664
Sir, Irumbanam-Vennala...

2366
02:05:04,744 --> 02:05:06,773
Numbers common to
these two towers...

2367
02:05:06,853 --> 02:05:08,310
'Common numbers?'
- Yes, I need the list of,

2368
02:05:08,390 --> 02:05:10,468
common numbers that fall under
Irumbanam-Vennala towers.

2369
02:05:10,548 --> 02:05:12,576
In both of the crime scenes,

2370
02:05:12,797 --> 02:05:14,917
we don't have any other common
link other than Dany.

2371
02:05:14,997 --> 02:05:17,294
Sir, he has committed
both the crimes.

2372
02:05:17,432 --> 02:05:19,247
He's simply making a
fool out of us.

2373
02:05:20,581 --> 02:05:23,286
But, these guys say that
it's not him.

2374
02:05:23,366 --> 02:05:25,334
Alright, please send all the
details on WhatsApp.

2375
02:05:25,414 --> 02:05:27,206
'I have sent it in our group.'
- Okay, thanks.

2376
02:05:29,470 --> 02:05:31,876
Sir, between the stipulated time,

2377
02:05:31,956 --> 02:05:35,372
There is a number, active under both
Irumbanam and Vennala towers.

2378
02:05:35,452 --> 02:05:37,501
Later, it was moving…

2379
02:05:37,581 --> 02:05:38,894
I have taken the details
of the number.

2380
02:05:38,974 --> 02:05:41,581
The number got switched off
at Kalamassery.

2381
02:05:41,661 --> 02:05:44,164
That is in the name of a lady.

2382
02:05:44,539 --> 02:05:45,747
Kavitha David.

2383
02:05:55,338 --> 02:05:56,706
Give me his mobile phone.

2384
02:05:58,122 --> 02:05:59,414
What is the number, you said?

2385
02:05:59,864 --> 02:06:02,001
8281...
- 8281...

2386
02:06:02,081 --> 02:06:04,372
91...
- 5667.

2387
02:06:08,403 --> 02:06:09,584
Who is this?

2388
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:11,626
Sir, she is my sister.
- Your sister?

2389
02:06:11,706 --> 02:06:13,584
Are you both messing with us?

2390
02:06:13,664 --> 02:06:15,456
What is this, sir?
- Where is she?

2391
02:06:15,581 --> 02:06:17,648
She is at her house.
- Place?

2392
02:06:17,728 --> 02:06:19,616
Sir... Sir, Kalamassery.

2393
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:21,410
Kalamassery.

2394
02:06:24,068 --> 02:06:26,221
Sir, my nephew
won't be asleep.

2395
02:06:26,654 --> 02:06:29,757
Sir, he will get scared.
Please, sir.

2396
02:06:30,708 --> 02:06:31,997
Zip your mouth, you...

2397
02:06:38,331 --> 02:06:39,417
We are cops.

2398
02:06:39,497 --> 02:06:40,497
Open the door!

2399
02:06:42,305 --> 02:06:44,070
Two of you go to the back door.

2400
02:06:49,899 --> 02:06:51,414
What's the matter, sir?

2401
02:06:53,721 --> 02:06:55,289
Kavitha David?

2402
02:06:57,034 --> 02:06:58,414
That's me.

2403
02:06:58,608 --> 02:06:59,568
What's the matter?

2404
02:06:59,648 --> 02:07:01,376
How did your phone number,

2405
02:07:01,456 --> 02:07:04,001
come under Irumbanam-Vennala
mobile tower last night,

2406
02:07:04,081 --> 02:07:05,831
between 10 -11.15.

2407
02:07:06,539 --> 02:07:07,698
I don't know, sir.

2408
02:07:07,778 --> 02:07:10,581
I hardly use my phone
because I'm carrying.

2409
02:07:10,661 --> 02:07:12,497
It's my husband who uses
my phone these days.

2410
02:07:12,664 --> 02:07:13,747
Where is your husband?

2411
02:07:30,039 --> 02:07:31,206
What is your name?

2412
02:07:31,872 --> 02:07:32,792
Jhony.

2413
02:07:32,872 --> 02:07:34,497
Where were you last night?

2414
02:07:34,997 --> 02:07:36,251
I was here.

2415
02:07:36,331 --> 02:07:38,872
Some people have seen you
around Irumbanam-Vennala at 10.00 pm.

2416
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:42,334
No, sir. He was here at home
from 8.00 pm yesterday.

2417
02:07:42,414 --> 02:07:43,751
He has not gone anywhere.

2418
02:07:43,831 --> 02:07:45,042
Sir, I was here only.

2419
02:07:45,122 --> 02:07:47,450
I was watching cricket on the TV.

2420
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:49,251
And, I slept around 12-12.30.

2421
02:07:49,331 --> 02:07:50,956
Where did you go just now?

2422
02:07:51,831 --> 02:07:53,955
I had gone to see off someone
at the bus stand.

2423
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:56,706
Who's that?
- My brother, Jakes.

2424
02:07:57,765 --> 02:07:59,494
He was here for the last one week.

2425
02:07:59,574 --> 02:08:01,581
He's working in Technopark,
Thiruvananthapuram.

2426
02:08:01,661 --> 02:08:03,164
He was...? What about now?

2427
02:08:03,244 --> 02:08:06,126
Dear, sir, no one is sure
about his things.

2428
02:08:06,206 --> 02:08:08,331
He was working in
a call centre there.

2429
02:08:08,488 --> 02:08:10,497
His salary was very less.

2430
02:08:10,849 --> 02:08:14,747
But his lifestyle is that
of a rich guy.

2431
02:08:15,052 --> 02:08:16,917
He has not been getting a salary
for the past 3-4 months.

2432
02:08:16,997 --> 02:08:18,372
That's what he said.

2433
02:08:18,539 --> 02:08:20,251
He has taken some
money from me.

2434
02:08:20,331 --> 02:08:23,247
How much?
- Around two and a half lakhs.

2435
02:08:23,327 --> 02:08:26,459
Last day, he quarrelled with
me as I asked for my money.

2436
02:08:26,539 --> 02:08:28,206
Was he out of the house
last night?

2437
02:08:28,539 --> 02:08:30,292
He comes and goes at odd hours.

2438
02:08:30,372 --> 02:08:31,751
He comes home at midnight and all.

2439
02:08:31,831 --> 02:08:34,039
What I asked is about
the last night?

2440
02:08:34,624 --> 02:08:36,334
He was out last night.

2441
02:08:36,414 --> 02:08:39,914
It was around 12-12.30 am
when we reached back.

2442
02:08:40,178 --> 02:08:41,956
Does he use this scooter?

2443
02:08:42,289 --> 02:08:44,664
Yes, he uses it when
he comes here.

2444
02:08:45,331 --> 02:08:47,164
What about your sister's mobile?

2445
02:08:47,746 --> 02:08:49,751
He was using her mobile
phone this time,

2446
02:08:49,831 --> 02:08:51,664
saying that his SIM card
is blocked.

2447
02:08:52,494 --> 02:08:55,372
Take down the details.
- Okay, sir.

2448
02:08:56,914 --> 02:08:59,292
It's both of you together
doing all these, right?

2449
02:08:59,372 --> 02:09:01,372
No, sir. Please trust me.

2450
02:09:01,456 --> 02:09:03,456
True that he had come
to my room.

2451
02:09:03,956 --> 02:09:05,501
He comes with a huge
list of impossible plans.

2452
02:09:05,581 --> 02:09:06,706
What plan?

2453
02:09:06,953 --> 02:09:10,459
He has loaned money from
a girl who works with him.

2454
02:09:10,539 --> 02:09:13,542
He has invested it in a money
chain like Bitcoin or something.

2455
02:09:13,622 --> 02:09:15,959
Now, the girl is after him
asking for her money...

2456
02:09:16,039 --> 02:09:18,792
Her husband has filed a
police case against him.

2457
02:09:18,872 --> 02:09:20,376
If you are not together,

2458
02:09:20,456 --> 02:09:23,084
how is he able to get to all
places before you reach there?

2459
02:09:23,164 --> 02:09:24,872
That's what even I
don't understand?

2460
02:09:25,747 --> 02:09:28,751
He had indeed come with
me that day to deliver food.

2461
02:09:28,831 --> 02:09:29,667
For what?

2462
02:09:29,747 --> 02:09:32,084
He was so adamant about
coming with me.

2463
02:09:32,164 --> 02:09:34,292
Why did you take him
along with you?

2464
02:09:34,372 --> 02:09:37,039
He was so adamant about
coming with me.

2465
02:09:37,119 --> 02:09:40,209
I took him along just to save him
from getting bored of sitting alone.

2466
02:09:40,289 --> 02:09:42,247
My dear, sir, I don't know
anything other than this.

2467
02:09:42,747 --> 02:09:43,751
Don't know, means?

2468
02:09:43,831 --> 02:09:45,126
Please trust me, sir.

2469
02:09:45,206 --> 02:09:47,706
Can we check Dany's phone
once more?

2470
02:09:49,289 --> 02:09:50,667
In which office is he working?

2471
02:09:50,747 --> 02:09:51,834
In Techno Park.

2472
02:09:51,914 --> 02:09:54,167
Hey, this is a problematic App.

2473
02:09:54,247 --> 02:09:55,622
Let me search for it.

2474
02:09:56,289 --> 02:09:58,292
Did you see him today?
- No, sir, I haven't.

2475
02:09:58,372 --> 02:10:01,696
Did he call or message you today?
- Sir.

2476
02:10:02,247 --> 02:10:03,701
An unauthorized
App called Mobile Spy,

2477
02:10:03,781 --> 02:10:05,164
has been installed on this phone.

2478
02:10:05,632 --> 02:10:08,356
The person who has installed
the app in this phone,

2479
02:10:08,436 --> 02:10:11,675
can access all the Apps in this
phone via another phone.

2480
02:10:11,848 --> 02:10:14,334
For example, Facebook,
WhatsApp...etc.

2481
02:10:14,414 --> 02:10:17,584
Jakes, what are you doing with
my phone all the time?

2482
02:10:17,664 --> 02:10:19,626
Dude, you keep aside all your
unworkable plans,

2483
02:10:19,706 --> 02:10:21,501
and start doing some job like this.

2484
02:10:21,581 --> 02:10:22,667
You will get quite a good salary.

2485
02:10:22,747 --> 02:10:24,292
Which bus did you see him off?

2486
02:10:24,372 --> 02:10:26,247
The Thiruvananthapuram bus, sir.

2487
02:10:26,713 --> 02:10:30,000
'Bravo 18 responding.'
- 'Noted!'

2488
02:10:30,422 --> 02:10:33,146
'A boy aged between
18 and 25 years has boarded,'

2489
02:10:33,226 --> 02:10:35,243
'the super-fast bus from Aluva
to Thiruvananthapuram...'

2490
02:10:35,323 --> 02:10:36,584
Hello, KSRTC here!

2491
02:10:36,664 --> 02:10:38,414
Sir, this is from Cyber Cell, Kochi.

2492
02:10:38,700 --> 02:10:40,897
There's something urgent
regarding a case.

2493
02:10:40,977 --> 02:10:43,251
Sir, I need the number of either
the driver or the conductor of the,

2494
02:10:43,331 --> 02:10:45,459
Thiruvananthapuram super-fast bus
that left at 4.00 am from the stand.

2495
02:10:45,539 --> 02:10:47,164
I want it now, it's urgent.

2496
02:10:48,039 --> 02:10:50,206
Sir, what's Ajayan's number... Who's
gone in the Thiruvananthapuram bus?

2497
02:10:57,683 --> 02:11:00,042
This is from Cyber Cell, Kochi.
- Cyber Cell?

2498
02:11:00,122 --> 02:11:01,997
Sir, don't panic.

2499
02:11:02,546 --> 02:11:04,477
We have information
that a suspect related to,

2500
02:11:04,557 --> 02:11:07,334
a murder case in Kochi
has boarded your bus.

2501
02:11:07,414 --> 02:11:08,649
We need to know about it.

2502
02:11:08,729 --> 02:11:10,292
This vehicle?
- Yes, yes.

2503
02:11:10,372 --> 02:11:12,042
We will send the photo
on WhatsApp.

2504
02:11:12,122 --> 02:11:13,542
Can you see if he's there
inside the bus...

2505
02:11:13,622 --> 02:11:16,045
You need not hang up the call.
- I'll call you back, sir.

2506
02:11:16,184 --> 02:11:17,626
Can you check that photo
and tell me?

2507
02:11:17,706 --> 02:11:18,706
Okay.

2508
02:11:42,039 --> 02:11:43,331
Hey, hello.

2509
02:11:50,956 --> 02:11:52,122
Ask him, what's it?

2510
02:11:53,081 --> 02:11:54,081
Sir.

2511
02:11:54,247 --> 02:11:56,501
No such man is there
inside this vehicle.

2512
02:11:56,581 --> 02:11:58,456
You must have gotten
the wrong bus.

2513
02:11:58,802 --> 02:12:00,747
Okay, sir.
- Okay, alright.

2514
02:12:06,378 --> 02:12:08,039
Sir.
- Sir.

2515
02:12:09,247 --> 02:12:11,102
He is not on the bus,
said the conductor.

2516
02:12:11,182 --> 02:12:13,164
Maybe he got into another
bus in between.

2517
02:12:25,747 --> 02:12:27,501
Sir, we had called
up Aluva stand,

2518
02:12:27,581 --> 02:12:29,539
and had taken the number of
the KSRTC conductor.

2519
02:12:29,708 --> 02:12:31,956
There's no such a man
in the bus, it seems.

2520
02:12:32,121 --> 02:12:34,122
Maybe he got into another
bus in between.

2521
02:12:59,431 --> 02:13:00,882
Hey, he's calling back. Hello.

2522
02:13:00,962 --> 02:13:03,251
'Sir, he's there inside the bus.'

2523
02:13:03,331 --> 02:13:04,539
'Come fast!'

2524
02:13:06,372 --> 02:13:08,039
Sir, he's there inside
the bus, it seems.

2525
02:13:21,664 --> 02:13:22,667
Where did he go?

2526
02:13:22,747 --> 02:13:24,569
Towards that side.
We couldn't catch him.

2527
02:13:24,649 --> 02:13:25,648
Downwards...

2528
02:13:26,105 --> 02:13:28,626
Get the vehicle down.
- Come on, fast.

2529
02:13:28,706 --> 02:13:29,997
Come on, sir.

2530
02:13:32,497 --> 02:13:34,403
He won't go beyond this, sir.

2531
02:13:34,483 --> 02:13:36,126
It's a swamp over there.

2532
02:13:36,206 --> 02:13:38,042
Sir, be careful.
- Show the lights towards there.

2533
02:13:38,122 --> 02:13:39,931
There will be snakes over there.

2534
02:13:40,011 --> 02:13:42,372
It's a swamp, no place
beyond this to run.

2535
02:13:42,854 --> 02:13:44,463
Sir, we can hear some
sound from there.

2536
02:13:44,679 --> 02:13:46,244
He must be somewhere here. Come!

2537
02:13:47,122 --> 02:13:49,459
Sir, the gate is lying open.

2538
02:13:49,539 --> 02:13:50,792
He has gone this way for sure.

2539
02:13:50,872 --> 02:13:52,331
See, the gate is open.

2540
02:13:59,247 --> 02:14:00,539
He must be somewhere inside this.

2541
02:14:00,789 --> 02:14:01,872
Do one thing.

2542
02:14:02,331 --> 02:14:04,158
Both of you, go that side.
- Okay, sir.

2543
02:14:04,238 --> 02:14:06,463
You, towards that side. Go.

2544
02:14:09,978 --> 02:14:11,206
Watch your way and go.

2545
02:14:14,071 --> 02:14:15,325
Be careful.

2546
02:14:53,414 --> 02:14:54,581
You go that way.

2547
02:14:57,544 --> 02:14:58,831
Is he over there, Danesh?

2548
02:15:10,001 --> 02:15:11,342
How dare you?

2549
02:15:12,622 --> 02:15:14,066
Damn! Leave me.

2550
02:15:14,831 --> 02:15:15,872
Sir...

2551
02:15:18,114 --> 02:15:19,809
Sir, please come.
- Leave me.

2552
02:15:22,015 --> 02:15:23,039
Antony...

2553
02:15:24,664 --> 02:15:26,126
You go catch him.

2554
02:15:29,206 --> 02:15:30,414
Sir...
- What is it?

2555
02:15:30,497 --> 02:15:32,042
Are you hurt?
- What did he run?

2556
02:15:32,122 --> 02:15:33,497
He ran towards that side.

2557
02:15:35,045 --> 02:15:37,216
Sir, we got him. Come fast.

2558
02:15:37,956 --> 02:15:39,622
Stop there!
- Sir...

2559
02:15:44,997 --> 02:15:46,456
Sir!

2560
02:15:47,245 --> 02:15:48,214
Thrash him, sir.

2561
02:15:52,969 --> 02:15:54,872
Are you playing with cops?

2562
02:16:02,331 --> 02:16:04,247
Don't wriggle, you idiot!

2563
02:16:07,290 --> 02:16:09,622
Are you trying to make
a fool out of us?

2564
02:16:11,122 --> 02:16:12,247
Please leave me, sir.

2565
02:16:22,113 --> 02:16:23,001
Wahab.

2566
02:16:23,081 --> 02:16:24,956
Get up, and stand straight.

2567
02:16:25,036 --> 02:16:26,459
Stand up.

2568
02:16:26,539 --> 02:16:28,688
Stand straight, I say!

2569
02:16:28,768 --> 02:16:30,664
Sir, please...
- Come on.

2570
02:16:31,141 --> 02:16:32,206
Walk, fast.

2571
02:16:32,823 --> 02:16:34,206
Is it locked from inside?

2572
02:16:34,636 --> 02:16:35,542
Drag him inside.

2573
02:16:35,622 --> 02:16:37,747
Did you think you can
make a fool out of us?

2574
02:16:38,581 --> 02:16:39,444
Get inside, all of you.

2575
02:16:39,524 --> 02:16:40,831
I got in, sir.

2576
02:16:42,789 --> 02:16:43,914
Did they get in?

2577
02:16:44,539 --> 02:16:45,956
What's their name?

2578
02:16:46,799 --> 02:16:48,289
Hey, show me your hands.
Let me see.

2579
02:16:50,258 --> 02:16:51,167
Yes, sir.

2580
02:16:51,247 --> 02:16:53,075
How is your hand?
- That's okay, sir.

2581
02:16:53,372 --> 02:16:54,783
Get into the vehicle.
We will drive you to the hospital.

2582
02:16:54,936 --> 02:16:56,444
No, sir...we have a bike...

2583
02:16:56,524 --> 02:16:57,997
We will go by ourselves.

2584
02:16:58,247 --> 02:16:59,581
What is your name?

2585
02:17:00,347 --> 02:17:01,372
Antony.

2586
02:17:01,789 --> 02:17:02,831
Vinay Dasan.

2587
02:17:47,414 --> 02:17:49,706
Okay, sir. Thank you, sir.

2588
02:17:51,539 --> 02:17:52,545
Come on in.

2589
02:17:55,539 --> 02:17:56,747
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

2590
02:17:57,215 --> 02:17:59,081
Did you go to the hospital?
- Yes, we did.

2591
02:18:00,456 --> 02:18:01,706
Dasan.

2592
02:18:04,372 --> 02:18:05,223
What is your plan?

2593
02:18:05,303 --> 02:18:07,039
Nothing, we want to sleep
for some time.

2594
02:18:07,119 --> 02:18:08,497
You should give us a
day's leave, okay?

2595
02:18:08,982 --> 02:18:10,831
My body hurts.

2596
02:18:11,914 --> 02:18:12,997
That's not it.

2597
02:18:13,328 --> 02:18:15,247
I asked you about your
plans.

2598
02:18:16,090 --> 02:18:17,997
Just go on... like this...

2599
02:18:26,740 --> 02:18:28,872
Joy. Please come here.

2600
02:18:34,301 --> 02:18:35,831
You want a smoke?
- No.

2601
02:18:35,956 --> 02:18:36,956
No, sir.

2602
02:18:39,620 --> 02:18:43,914
How long can you continue doing
a worthless job like this?

2603
02:18:44,459 --> 02:18:46,168
The government has
decided to lay off,

2604
02:18:46,248 --> 02:18:48,189
temporary employees
from KSRTC and KSEB.

2605
02:18:48,581 --> 02:18:49,835
It's the same here as well.

2606
02:18:49,915 --> 02:18:50,997
Isn't it?

2607
02:18:52,331 --> 02:18:53,831
Are you sending us away?

2608
02:18:55,831 --> 02:18:58,917
Secure your life somewhere else,
without getting insulted here.

2609
02:18:58,997 --> 02:19:00,501
Go.
- Dear, sir...

2610
02:19:00,899 --> 02:19:02,664
We love working here, sir.

2611
02:19:03,431 --> 02:19:05,164
We will somehow stay here.

2612
02:19:05,372 --> 02:19:06,497
We don't want any salary.

2613
02:19:07,622 --> 02:19:09,376
Please. Sir.

2614
02:19:09,456 --> 02:19:10,539
Dear, you can't...

2615
02:19:11,194 --> 02:19:12,622
It's an order from the government.

2616
02:19:13,664 --> 02:19:14,622
Sir.

2617
02:19:14,747 --> 02:19:15,831
You go, dear.

2618
02:19:16,664 --> 02:19:18,164
It's nothing, but...

2619
02:19:18,831 --> 02:19:23,414
We will become a zero
in front of everyone.

2620
02:19:23,706 --> 02:19:24,667
That's why.

2621
02:19:24,747 --> 02:19:26,331
This is the nature of our system.

2622
02:19:27,747 --> 02:19:28,831
Go and find something better.

2623
02:19:30,851 --> 02:19:32,164
You may go.

2624
02:19:33,155 --> 02:19:34,164
Sir...

2625
02:22:27,247 --> 02:22:29,414
'In life, there's a blockade
everywhere, isn't it?'

2626
02:22:30,352 --> 02:22:32,334
'Only those blocked
somewhere have succeeded in life.'

2627
02:22:32,414 --> 02:22:33,872
'Fresh proverb, huh?'

2628
02:22:34,149 --> 02:22:35,251
'Where did you get it from?'

2629
02:22:35,331 --> 02:22:36,872
'My friend who's a moron told me.'

2630
02:22:36,952 --> 02:22:38,456
'But, that's true.'

2631
02:22:39,226 --> 02:22:40,497
'Get lost, brat!'
